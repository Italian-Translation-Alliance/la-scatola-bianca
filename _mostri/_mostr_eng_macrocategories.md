## Abomination

Abominations (often called hybrids) are fusions of two normal creatures that are just as often intelligent as they are rampaging beasts. No one knows how abominations came to be: perhaps the result of experimentation by a mad wizard or druid, a *wish* spell gone awry, or the wrath of a deity. The end result that fuses two creatures together often destroys the mind of the hapless beings, forcing them into madness and evil. The most well known examples of abominations are hippogriffs, griffons, gorilla-bears, and the terrible owlbear.

## Amphorons of Yothri

Amphorons of Yothri are mechanisms created by the Artificers of that plane (see, “Artificers of Yothri”) using their strange magic-science. Amphorons on the material plane are physical projections of a model that remains on Yothri – the Artificer’s mind, possibly using a lens apparatus of some kind, projects the device into the material plane, where it has a physical reality.

These projections can fail, and, moreover, the Artificer’s control of more than one Amphoron at a time depends on his mental connection to a single, controlling Amphoron. If the Artificer attempts to switch his mental connection from one Amphoron to another, the process takes 1d6 rounds to complete.

In any given round, any Amphoron has a 1 in 6 chance to “flicker,” due to a momentary interruption of the connection across time and space. While flickering, the Amphoron cannot be attacked, and cannot inflict damage. However, it regains 1 hit point when it rematerializes. A flickering Amphoron is visible as a faint, static-shrouded shape. In the following round, the Amphoron reappears (unless it fails a second roll of the d6).

The controlling Amphoron has only a 1 in 20 chance of flickering, but if it does so, all of the Amphorons under its control will flicker. Any Amphoron can be used as the controller, but a single controller cannot control more than six other Amphorons, and an Artificer can only project his mind to one controller at a time. Thus, unless the Artificer has projected some apparatus (the possibilities are many, and left to the Referee’s creativity) to allow remote controllers or auto-controls, the maximum number of Amphorons encountered at time is seven (six controlled and one controller). When the Artificer’s nefarious schemes on the material plane are complete, he will likely not bother to disintegrate his Amphorons, so their material substance will remain on the material plane, operating randomly, remaining completely inert, or proceeding independently with their rudimentary intelligence.

All Amphorons have a metallic, jointed shell; their insides are filled with wires and a gel-like flesh which allows the mental connection with the distant reality of Yothri, and also gives the creature its basic intelligence. There are three varieties of Amphoron, although the Referee could design others with little effort. *(Author Matt Finch; first appeared in [Knockspell Magazine #1](http://shop.d20pfsrd.com/collections/knockspell-magazine/products/knockspell-issue-1)).*

## Angels

Angels are a race of celestials native to the lawfully-aligned outer planes.

## Animal Lords

For every animal species, there is a single ruler or lord, looked upon by those animals as a minor deity of sorts. The animal lord is the master of that species; for example, there is a fox lord, mouse lord, and a cat lord. Each animal can assume two forms: human and animal. Its animal form is always of a member of the species it represents. Animal lords are seen as protectors of nature and animals. They may step in and prevent hunters from destroying a race of animals or foresters from completely decimating a forest. They do not, however, interfere with nature itself (i.e., animals die, they are killed for food or clothing)—such is the way of the universe.

## Animated Objects

Animated objects generally do not have minds of their own, being animated by a spell rather than by a spirit of some kind.They may follow programmed instructions, or might follow the orders of a master if the master is actually present. Since there are so many possible types of objects, and so many different ways in which an object might be animated, the exact details of the object are left to the Referee. Two examples are provided, although even with animated chairs and tables the exact details can (and should) occasionally differ.

## Ant, Giant

Giant ants live in vast subterranean hives tunneled through soil and even stone. A hive can hold as many as 100 ants, in a worker-to-warrior ratio of 5:1. The poison of a warrior ant does 2d6 points of damage if a saving throw is failed, 1d4 points of damage if the saving throw succeeds.

## Bears

## Beetles (Giant)

## Bumblebee, Giant

## Centipedes, Giant

## Clockworks

Clockworks are the creations of powerful machines called brain gears. Each clockwork creature varies from its brethren and each is assigned a task by the brain gear that created it. Clockworks are automatons and follow orders without question. It is through these various clockwork creations that brain gears seek to destroy all living creatures. They come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes.

The clockwork creations controlled by a brain gear share several characteristics. Most constructs are immediately destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points. Clockworks with the self-repair special quality, however, are not destroyed at 0 or less hit points. While they do cease to function, they continue to self-repair, only at a slower rate. Once it has self-repaired itself to at least 1 hit point, the clockwork begins functioning normally again.

Some clockworks (see below) can automatically repair themselves with spare parts and scrap, and a built-in mechanism allows them to self-repair even when seemingly destroyed. The clockwork automatically heals damage at a fixed rate per round, as given in the clockwork’s entry. Certain attack forms, typically acid, cold, and fire cannot be self-repaired. The clockwork’s descriptive text describes the details.

A clockwork with self-repair can repair lost limbs (including its head), but it takes 3d6 rounds to do so. A clockwork reduced to 0 or less hit points is not destroyed, but begins to self-repair damage at one-half its normal rate (minimum 1 hit point per round). It still cannot repair damage dealt by acid, cold, or fire effects. For example, a clockwork with self-repair 3 normally regains 3 hit points per round. If reduced to 0 or less hit points, it regains 1 hit point per round until it has at least 1 hit point (at which time it self-repairs at its normal rate).

## Crocodiles

## Daemons

Demons are creatures of the lower planes of existence, but they are occasionally encountered in places where they have been enslaved to serve as guardians by powerful magic-users or evil priests. The more intelligent varieties might also be interrupted while carrying out plots of their own. *Swords & Wizardry* makes no game distinction between demons and daemons, for the convenience of those using only a three-alignment system; all are simply creatures of the lower planes, to be used as desired with the Referee’s own campaign.

## Demodands

Demons are creatures of the lower planes of existence, but they are occasionally encountered in places where they have been enslaved to serve as guardians by powerful magic-users or evil priests. The more intelligent varieties might also be interrupted while carrying out plots of their own. *Swords & Wizardry* makes no game distinction between demons and demodands, for the convenience of those using only a three-alignment system; all are simply creatures of the lower planes, to be used as desired with the Referee’s own campaign.

## Dinosaurs

Dinosaurs are particularly useful in time-traveling adventures, for valleys that time forgot, or for the mounts of sword & sorcery barbarians.

## Dragons

The size of a dragon is roughly 5 ft of body length per age category, up to the adult size of 20 ft. Dragons have double normal treasure (that is, a gold piece value of four times the dragon’s XP value).

Do not roll hit points for dragons as normal. Instead, determine the number of hit dice and the age category of the dragon. The age category indicates both the dragon’s hit points per die and how much damage the dragon’s breath weapon inflicts, given as points per hit die.:

Note that dragons, while they are dangerous opponents, are not by any means invincible. In a medieval-type fantasy world, dragons are a common problem rather than godlike creatures of legend—so the statistics for dragons reflect a deadly but not mythical foe. The Referee is, of course, free to create stats for a more “mythical” conception of dragons. Since dice are not rolled for dragon hit points, it is possible for a truly mythical dragon to have more points per die than it is actually possible to roll on a hit die.

Breath Weapons: All dragons have a breath weapon of some kind, which can be used three times in a day. The Referee chooses when a dragon will use its breath weapon, or may roll a 60% chance in any given round. Damage inflicted by a dragon’s breath weapon is indicated under the age category. When used breath weapons appear in three different shapes:

**1** — Cloud-shape for gaseous exhalations
**2** — A line, for spitting dragons**3** — Cone shape for any others.

The dimensions of a dragon’s breath differ according to the dragon’s type.

If a dragon is beaten down by subdual damage (see rules for Combat), the dragon will surrender and serve its conquerors, even to the point of allowing itself to be sold. However, subdued dragons are only loyal while they are impressed by and frightened of their masters; signs of weakness may cause the dragon to escape or even attack its master.

A standard-colored dragon generally has a challenge level based on its hit points: CL=(hp/4) +2.

## Elementals

Elementals are living manifestations of the basic forms of matter: earth, air, fire, and water. They are usually summoned from their native planes of existence to do the bidding of a powerful wizard. These beings can also be “chained” within objects or structures to give the objects magical properties. Elementals are barely intelligent at all, but they are as powerful as the forces of nature that they actually are.

## Elemental Constructs

Elemental constructs are golems or automatons forged of one of the four basic elements—air, earth, fire, or water—bound to serve their creator. The creation of an elemental construct requires no less than five elemental spirits (of the same type) which are unwillingly bound into the form of the elemental construct.

Elemental constructs are used by powerful mages as servants, bodyguards, and assassins. An elemental construct, like any other automaton follows any order or command given to it to the best of its ability.

An elemental construct’s creator can command it if the construct is within 60 feet and can see and hear its creator. If not commanded, an elemental construct usually follows its last instruction to the best of its ability, though if attacked it returns the attack. The creator can give the elemental construct a simple command to govern its actions in his or her absence. The elemental construct’s creator can order the construct to obey the commands of another person (who might in turn place the elemental construct under someone else’s control, and so on), but the elemental construct’s creator can always resume control over his creation by commanding the elemental construct to obey him alone.

Each elemental construct appears as a humanoid creature about 9 feet tall and is composed entirely of its native element.

## Exoskeletons

## Frog

## Genie

## Giants

Giants are a staple of fantasy gaming, huge and dangerous creatures that often have a taste for human flesh. Most are not particularly intelligent.

## Goblins

## Golems

Golems are man-shaped creatures built to serve their masters, usually powerful wizards or high priests. They are often used as guardians. Golems cannot be hit with non-magical weapons, and are immune to the sorts of spells used to create them (iron golems being immune to fire, for instance). You can find the details in the specific monster descriptions.

## Graymalkins

Graymalkins are magical creatures that resemble ordinary cats. To the casual observer, a graymalkin appear to be nothing more than a raggedy-looking cat with nothing unusual about it. This disguise aids the graymalkin in its travels, allowing it to move unmolested among living creatures.

Graymalkins always dwell near populated areas, preferring cities to towns, towns to villages, and so on. They often choose an owner (a living creature they deem gullible and easily manipulated) and convince that creature to take them home with them (by using their fascination ability). Once inside their owner’s house, a graymalkin uses its special abilities to kill its owner and any other family members. Such attacks usually occur at night (in the case of the slinker) or over a period of time (in the case of the tether).

Graymalkins are often found serving as the familiar to an evil spellcaster or hag. They prefer females to males when serving as a familiar and very rarely do they ever use their special abilities against their true owner. (Some tales say that when a graymalkin is serving as a familiar, its master is actually immune to its special abilities.)

Graymalkins avoid direct confrontations with opponents, preferring to attack helpless or otherwise unobservant foes. If forced into battle, a graymalkin seeks escape as quick as possible.

## Hags

## Humans

Humans are such a versatile race that any number of “monsters” and NPCs can be made from them. Berserker warriors, tribesmen, cavemen, princesses, evil high priests, captains of the guard, foot-soldiers, and tavern-keepers are all different human “monsters.” Don’t try to build your non-player characters according to the rules for player characters. Just make up their stats and abilities as you see fit.

## Inphidian

Somewhere in humanities lost aeons a race of malformed serpentine humanoids rose, now known as inphidians.

While the truth of their origins has been long forgotten, most sages subscribe to one of two theories. The first states the creatures are the failed results of horrific experiments performed by the dark and nameless sorcerers of an ancient snake-cult in their attempts to ensorcel their followers. The second theory contends the inphidians were once a cult of snake-worshippers cursed by an ancient snake-god for some transgression against the ethos. Whatever the truth, it appears as of late that the inphidians have evolved into true race, beyond the machinations of arcane experiments or curses. While there exist several known species, recent reports describe encounters with yet unidentified inphidians and others are sure to surface as encounters with the race grow more frequent.

Inphidians, regardless of their subspecies, have viper heads in place of their hands. The creatures use these in combat to deliver a powerful bite that injects the victim with poison. Some inphidians, particularly the craftsmen, wear special gloves called *inphidian gauntlets* that let them use their hands like any other humanoid with five digits.

## Lycanthropes

Lycanthropes are were-creatures, particularly those in whom the disease permits assumption of a hybrid form of the human and animal. They cannot be hit by normal weapons: only silver and magical weapons affect them. If anyone is attacked and brought below 50% hit points by a lycanthrope, the person will become a lycanthrope himself.

## Mechanisms

Mechanisms are, effectively, magically-constructed robots. They are not merely animated, for they have a mechanical component to their operations, but these mechanical components require magic in order to function.

## Mephit

Mephits are minor spirits usually related to fire and heat, that can, from time to time, be loosed on the Material Planes by natural means (such as a volcanic eruption) or by supernatural means (such as being summoned by wizards or sent on errands by demons or devils). All of these creatures have the ability to turn into a (mephitic) bad-smelling gaseous form for 1d6 rounds, once per day.


## Naga

“Naga” is the Sanskrit word for dragon or snake. In mythology, the naga are benevolent and very powerful, equivalent to Asian dragons. The nagas portrayed here are more serpentine and less powerful; all have the body of a snake, although the head is not necessarily that of a serpent. All kinds of interesting abilities may be found in “unusual” nagas designed by the Referee, from breathing fire to moving in and out of strange planes of existence.
