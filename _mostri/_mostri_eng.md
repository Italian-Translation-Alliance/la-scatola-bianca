### Aardvark, Giant

Giant aardvarks resemble their smaller cousins, with a long, pig-like snout, rabbit-like ears, and a kangaroo-like tail. Instead of digging for termites like the normal aardvark, giant aardvarks, which can measure as large as twenty feet in length, tend to dig into cottages and subterranean burrows for large prey such as humans, goblins, and ankhegs. The giant aardvark’s tongue is ten feet long, and is used to suck prey into the aardvark’s mouth.

A successful hit with the tongue forces the target to make a saving throw or be yanked into the aardvark’s mouth and swallowed. The monster can be attacked from within (at an **AC** of 9 \[10\]) but only with a short weapon such as a dagger. Anyone inside the aardvark’s stomach takes 1d6 points of damage per round as he is digested. Giant aardvarks don’t eat more than a couple of people before they lose interest. *(Author Matt Finch)*

- Giant Aardvark: **HD** 9; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 1 tongue (swallows), 2 claws (1d8); **Save** 6; **Move** 6; **AL N; CL/XP** 11/1700; **Special**: Swallow whole.

### Aaztar-Ghola

Aaztar-gholas are ancient creatures originating from some other dimension, foul things that have established themselves in the prime material plane. They are tall, and attire their hideous bodies in flowing, richly embroidered robes, adorning themselves with strange, baroque jewelry. Aaztar-gholas find human flesh delectable, especially when it is cooked with the strange spices with which they flavor their food. An aaztar-ghola lair often contains cauldrons, skewers, and several more alien and disturbing culinary implements.

Aaztar-gholas have a particular necromantic affinity with ghouls, which for some reason obey their commands without any perceptible reluctance. The lair of an aaztar-ghola is likely (90% chance) to be guarded by a pack of 2d6+6 of these undead. In the presence of an aaztar-ghola, ghouls are highly resistant to being turned; treat them as vampires for this purpose. Ghasts are also willing to serve aaztar-gholas, but they do so for their own purposes; they are unaffected by the strange control that aaztar-gholas have over ordinary ghouls. Aaztar-gholas themselves are not undead and thus cannot be turned, although as creatures not inherently native to the prime material plane they are affected by *protection from evil*.

These horrid creatures are natural adepts of the necromantic arts, and all of them have spellcasting powers. Once per day, an aaztar-ghola can cast the following spells: *cause light wounds* x2 (at a range of 50ft), *fly, detect invisibility, dispel magic*, and *finger of death*. They are capable of speaking with any sort of undead creature, even those such as zombies that have no intellect at all. This ability to communicate with the undead does not imply the ability to control; ghouls are the only undead creatures that automatically follow commands given by an aaztar-ghola. *(Author Matt Finch)*

- Aaztar-Ghola: **HD** 6; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 2 swords (1d8); **Save** 11; **Move** 12; **AL C; CL/XP** 9/1100; **Special**: Spells, magic resistance 25%

### Aberrant

Aberrants are hideous giants standing about 14 feet tall, with deformed bodies and limbs. Aberrants are covered in coarse, dark hair or blisters (for those without body hair). They make their homes in caves, abandoned mines, or deep underground away from civilization. Many have physical deformities, such as a misplaced or extra arm (an extra attack), eyes on the sides or back of their head (to see people sneaking up on them), flapping ears (to better hear) or a huge nose (to smell creatures).

- Aberrant: **HD** 8; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 1 great club (2d8); **Save** 8 **Move** 12; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 9/1100; **Special**: Physical deformity

### Aboleth

The aboleth is a revolting fish-like amphibian, primarily subterranean, roughly the size of a killer whale. It vaguely resembles a catfish, but has four long tentacles and four orifices along its belly. The tentacles can be used to drag its bulk across dry land. These horrid abominations are extremely intelligent: an aboleth can cast charm monster three times per day, and create a phantasmal force three times per day. In the water, an aboleth surrounds itself with a cloud of mucus that requires anyone inhaling it to make a saving throw or become unable to breathe air for 3 hours.Finally, the slime on an aboleth’s tentacles causes disease if a saving throw fails. Those afflicted suffer a change to their skin, which must be immersed in water every hour, or the victim suffers 1d6 points of damage.

- Aboleth: **HD** 9; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 4 tentacles (1d6 + slime); **Save** 6; **Move** 9 (swim 12); **AL** C; **CL/XP** 12/2000; **Special**: Charm monster (3/day), Phantasmal force (3/day), Mucus cloud in water (save or cannot breathe air for 3 hours), special disease upon successful hit (save or must be immersed in water every hour).

### Abomination

Abominations (often called hybrids) are fusions of two normal creatures that are just as often intelligent as they are rampaging beasts. No one knows how abominations came to be: perhaps the result of experimentation by a mad wizard or druid, a *wish* spell gone awry, or the wrath of a deity. The end result that fuses two creatures together often destroys the mind of the hapless beings, forcing them into madness and evil. The most well known examples of abominations are hippogriffs, griffons, gorilla-bears, and the terrible owlbear.

#### Owlephant

This massive creature looks like an elephant with the head of a giant owl. Beneath its tusks, two clawed arms protrude from its body, one to each side of its elephantine trunk. Its feathered owl head is dark brown, fading to gray as it blends into its elephant-like body. An owlephant can trample opponent simply by moving over them. Those who fail a saving throw suffer 2d8 points of damage each. Those who pass a saving throw leap to the side to avoid the beast. Folk who choose not to avoid the trample attack can make a counter attack at a +1 bonus to hit.

- Abomination (Owlephant): **HD** 10; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** Slam (2d6) and 2 claws (2d8) or gore (2d8); **Save** 5; **Move** 12; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 10/1400; **Special**: Trample

#### Tigrilla

This creature looks like a gorilla with the head of a tiger. Its arms end in sharpened claws and its fur is orange-brown. Its head is striped like that of a normal tiger.

A tigrilla attacks by raking with its claws and biting with its fangs. If it hits the same opponent with both claws attacks it rakes with the claws, inflicting an additional 1d8 points of damage.

- Abomination (Tigrilla): **HD** 5; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d8); **Save** 12 **Move** 15 (Climb 9); **AL** N; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Rake with claws

### Abyssal Harvester (Fourth-Category Demon)

This gigantic beast stands nearly 40 feet tall. It is a squat, bloated mass of grayish, leathery flesh, somewhat in an oval shape with six long, serpentine tentacles. A massive gaping maw dominates its top surface. Hundreds of smaller tentacles allow the creature to move. The tentacles, if they hit, constrict for automatic damage after the initial hit. An abyssal harvester – which normally resides in the Abyss – can push up to four tentacles into the world. These tentacles appear out of thin air and can attack and grab victims to “harvest” by dragging them back through the rift to the Abyss.

- Abyssal Harvester (Fourth-Category Demon): **HD** 15; **AC** 1 \[18\]; **Atk** 6 tentacles (2d6); **Save** 3 **Move** 6; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 17/3500; **Special**: Constrict, harvest

### Abyssal Larva

Abyssal larva look like puffy, bloated human-sized whitish-yellow maggots with purplish veins pulsating under their fleshy forms. A vaguely humanoid head sits atop its body and its facial features are twisted and distraught, as if the creature was in a constant state of pain. A pair of large, downward-curving horns juts from its head, just above its sunken eyes. Its mouth is lined with filthy, sharpened fangs. Once per day, an abyssal larva can regurgitate and spray a stream of maggots at a victim within 10 feet. If the creature fails a save, it is sickened.

- Abyssal Larva: **HD** 3; **AC** 8 \[11\]; **Atk** acidic bite (2d4); **Save** 14 **Move** 6; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: maggot spray

### Adherer

The adherer is a subterranean humanoid whose folds of filthy, pale skin cause it to resemble a mummy. It exudes sticky, sour smelling glue from its skin that sticks to anything other than stone, including melee attacks. Each successful melee attack requires a saving throw to avoid it sticking fast to the weird creature. Once a creature is stuck, it suffers 1d4 damage per round from the grapple. The glue is dissolved by boiling water, and it breaks down 1 hour after the creature dies.

- Adherer: **HD** 4; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 2 slams (1d4); **Save** 13 **Move** 12; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Adhesive, double damage from fire, resistance to blunt weapons (50%), surprise on 1-3 on 1d6

### Aerial Servant

Aerial servants are semi-intelligent creatures from the Elemental Plane of Air that often roam the Astral and Ethereal planes. They normally are only found on the Material Plane as a result of being summoned by a cleric using the *aerial servant* spell and commanded to perform some task, often being required to use their immense strength to carry objects or aid the summoner. Though an aerial servant performs whatever task is asked of it, it resents being summoned and forced to do another’s bidding; therefore, it attempts to pervert the conditions of the summoning and its mission. An aerial servant that fails or is thwarted in its mission becomes insane and immediately returns to the caster who summoned it, either killing the caster or carrying the caster back to the Elemental Plane of Air with it. Aerial servants are naturally invisible, and thus remain invisible even while attacking. Aerial servants can only be killed on their native plane. If slain elsewhere, they simply dissolve into wisps of vapor and return to their home plane.

Aerial servants attack by using a shearing blast of wind as a weapon or by grabbing an opponent and crushing it within their powerful grasp. An aerial servant can use its wind blast once every 1d4 rounds. The wind blast has a range of 80 feet and can be used against a single target, inflicting 4d8 points of damage and knocking them back 2d10 feet. The target can roll a saving throw to halve the damage and avoid being knocked back. An aerial servant grapple inflicts 4d4 points of damage each round and is notoriously difficult to break.

- Aerial Servant: **HD** 16; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** Slam (4d4); **Save** 3 **Move** 24 (Fly 24); **AL** N; **CL/XP** 20/4400; **Special**: Throttle, invisibility, only harmed by magic weapons, wind blast

### Afanc

An afanc is a massive, gray-skinned whale with a bulbous head similar to a catfish. Its eyes are sullen and blue and its huge pectoral fins are serrated. These omnivorous hunters roam the deep sea. If an afanc rolls a 15 or above on its bite attack, it grasps a victim in its toothy maw and swallows the creature whole on the next round. When facing surface ships, an afanc can raise its entire body out of the water and crash down on the surface to generate a 30-foot-tall wave to swamp vessels.

- Afanc: **HD** 21; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** Bite (5d6), 2 claws (2d8); **Save** 3; **Move** 3 (Swim 30); **AL** C; **CL/XP** 23/5300; **Special**: Swallow whole, sea swell

### Ahlinni (Cackle Bird)

The ahlinni, or cackle bird (so called because of its breath weapon) is a 5-foot-tall flightless bird that dwells in thick forests. It is covered in greenish feathers, and is nearly invisible when it lies motionless in its leafy surroundings. The bird’s beak is half the length of its body, and as straight and strong as a long sword (2d8 damage). Wicked claws also sprout from its wings. Once every three rounds, an ahlinni can expel a pinkish gas that causes creatures that fail a save to fall to the ground laughing manically for 1d3 rounds.

- Ahlinni: **HD** 4; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d8) or impale (2d8), 2 claws (1d4); **Save** 13; **Move** 15; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Breath weapon, impale

### Air Gust

These minor elementals from the plane of Air resemble little whirlwinds. Although no more than a few feet in height and width, these tiny tornadoes can easily send the bulkiest adventurer flying in a range of up to 15-ft. The victim of a successful hit by an air gust has a 2 in 6 chance of being knocked down (the referee may wish to modify the roll to take into account exceptional strength).

The violent air gusts that make up this elemental’s form (and give it its name) make missile/ranged attacks difficult and afford the elemental a bonus of 2 to AC. *(Author: Skathros).*

- Air Gust: **HD** 3; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** Wind Blast (1d6+1 + Knockdown - Range up to 15 ft.); **Save** 14; **Move** 12 (18 fly); **AL** N; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: -2 \[+2\] to AC vs. missile attacks.

### Algoid

The algoid is a living colony of algae that has developed some semblance of intelligence and mobility. It roughly resembles a green humanoid. Algoids make their lairs in marshes and swamps. They are often encountered with other marsh-dwelling sentient plants; though never with shambling mounds (they hate them and usually attack them on sight). In its natural surroundings, it is nearly invisible until it attacks and uses this to its advantage when prey is nearby. Algoids can “wake” trees as do treants. Once per day, an algoid can use a mind blast in a 60-foot cone. Any creature caught in the cone must succeed on a saving throw or be stunned for 3d4 rounds. *Control water* spells deal 1d6 points of damage per caster level to algoids, with no saving throw allowed.

- Algoid: **HD** 5; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 2 slams (1d10); **Save** 12; **Move** 9; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 7/600; **Special**: Immunity to electricity and fire, resistance to blunt weapons (50%), mind blast, surprise on 1-3 on 1d6

### Allip

Allips are shadowy, incorporeal undead that mutter and speak with the voice of madness from beyond the grave. The voice acts as a Suggestion spell upon anyone hearing the quiet mutterings: the suggestions of an allip are usually senseless but sinister. The allip’s touch does not deal damage, but causes the victim to lose 1d4 points of wisdom. If a victim’s wisdom falls to 0, it dies and will become an allip within 2d6 days. Allips can only be hit with magical or silver weapons.

- Allip: **HD** 4; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 1 strike (no damage, 1d4 points of wisdom lost); **Move** (fly 6); **Save** 13; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 7/600; **Special**: drains wisdom, hypnosis.

### Al-mi'raj

The al-mi’raj is a large rabbit with white, pink, yellow, or light green fur and a long golden or black horn. Al-mi’raj can *blink* (as the spell) and use a *dimension door* effect once per round. Rare al’mi’raj are more intelligent than their kin and have the following psionic powers: *Control winds, darkness 15-ft. radius, levitate* and *telekinesis*. These psionic al-mi’raj have a challenge level of 3.

- Al-mi'raj: **HD** 1d6; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** Horn (1d6); **Save** 18; **Move** 24; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 2/30; **Special**: Blink, dimension door, immune to poison, magic resistance 30%

### Amphisbaena

The amphisbaena is a giant poisonous snake about 10 feet long. It is often found lairing near a water source or in dark, damp locations. An amphisbaena moves on land by grasping one of its necks with its other head and rolling across the ground like a hoop. The amphisbaena’s poison is deadly unless the victim passes a saving throw. Each of the amphisbaena’s heads functions independently of the other. An amphisbaena that is cut in half continues to function normally (each with half its current hit points) and reattaches its body together in 1d2 days.

- Amphisbaena: **HD** 6; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 2 bites (1d6 plus poison); **Save** 11; **Move** 9 (Climb and Swim 9); **AL** N; **CL/XP** 7/600; **Special**: Resistance to cold (50%), split, cannot be surprised

### Amphisbaena Basilisk

An amphisbaena basilisk is a single great lizard composed of two normal basilisks conjoined in the middle. Each head’s gaze can turns to stone anyone meeting its eye. Fighting without trying to look at the creature incurs a -4 penalty to hit. If the amphisbaena basilisk’s gaze is reflected back at it, it has a 10% chance to force the basilisk into a saving throw against being turned to stone itself.

- Amphisbaena Basilisk: **HD** 6; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 2 bites (2d6); **Save** 11; **Move** 12; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 10/1,400; **Special**: Petrifying gaze

### Amphorons of Yothri

Amphorons of Yothri are mechanisms created by the Artificers of that plane (see, “Artificers of Yothri”) using their strange magic-science. Amphorons on the material plane are physical projections of a model that remains on Yothri – the Artificer’s mind, possibly using a lens apparatus of some kind, projects the device into the material plane, where it has a physical reality.

These projections can fail, and, moreover, the Artificer’s control of more than one Amphoron at a time depends on his mental connection to a single, controlling Amphoron. If the Artificer attempts to switch his mental connection from one Amphoron to another, the process takes 1d6 rounds to complete.

In any given round, any Amphoron has a 1 in 6 chance to “flicker,” due to a momentary interruption of the connection across time and space. While flickering, the Amphoron cannot be attacked, and cannot inflict damage. However, it regains 1 hit point when it rematerializes. A flickering Amphoron is visible as a faint, static-shrouded shape. In the following round, the Amphoron reappears (unless it fails a second roll of the d6).

The controlling Amphoron has only a 1 in 20 chance of flickering, but if it does so, all of the Amphorons under its control will flicker. Any Amphoron can be used as the controller, but a single controller cannot control more than six other Amphorons, and an Artificer can only project his mind to one controller at a time. Thus, unless the Artificer has projected some apparatus (the possibilities are many, and left to the Referee’s creativity) to allow remote controllers or auto-controls, the maximum number of Amphorons encountered at time is seven (six controlled and one controller). When the Artificer’s nefarious schemes on the material plane are complete, he will likely not bother to disintegrate his Amphorons, so their material substance will remain on the material plane, operating randomly, remaining completely inert, or proceeding independently with their rudimentary intelligence.

All Amphorons have a metallic, jointed shell; their insides are filled with wires and a gel-like flesh which allows the mental connection with the distant reality of Yothri, and also gives the creature its basic intelligence. There are three varieties of Amphoron, although the Referee could design others with little effort. *(Author Matt Finch; first appeared in [Knockspell Magazine #1](http://shop.d20pfsrd.com/collections/knockspell-magazine/products/knockspell-issue-1)).*

#### Worker Amphoron

Worker Amphorons are just smaller than a human, and move with crab-like legs (although they can levitate for up to 3 rounds once per day, if need be). As with other Amphorons, they have a 1 in 6 chance of flickering unless used as a controller by the Artificer. In addition to the chance of flickering, a worker Amphoron may randomly belch out arcs of electricity, inflicting 1hp damage to anyone within 10ft (in addition to its other actions).

- Amphoron (Worker): **HD** 2; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 2 pincer-arms (1d6); **Save** 16; **Move** 9; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: magic resistance 25%, immune to piercing weapons, chance of flickering, chance of electrical belch.

#### Warrior Amphoron

Warrior Amphorons are usually used to protect Worker Amphorons, or in situations where the Artificer’s schemes involve violence. They have a flamethrower which is in constant operation, allowing the Amphoron to shoot a line of flame at a single target up to 100ft away in addition to its other attacks. The flame inflicts 1d6 damage (saving throw for half damage).

- Amphoron (Warrior): **HD** 5; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 2 pincer arms (1d6+2); **Save** 12; **Move** 9; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: magic resistance 25%, immune to piercing weapons, chance of flickering, flamethrower.

#### Juggernaut Amphoron

The Juggernaut Amphoron is a harvester/processor the size of a semi-attached trailer truck, with a moving crane mounted on its back and two huge circular saws mounted on its articulated arms. If the Juggernaut’s crane hits an opponent, the victim is lifted up into the air over the Juggernaut’s processing hatch, and dropped automatically in the following round. If the crane hits, a saving throw is permitted to escape the its grasp unless the target is wearing metal armor, in which case no saving throw is allowed (the crane contains a backup magnet). Anyone dropped into the processing hatch is processed within 1d4 rounds into a small brick.

- Amphoron (Juggernaut): **HD** 10; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 2 whirling blades (2d6+2) or crane; **Save** 5; **Move** 9; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 13/2300; **Special**: magic resistance 25%, crane, chance of flickering.

### Anemone, Great (Giant) Sea

This gigantic flowerlike creature has a dark green to gray trunk and a brightly colored interior. At the center of the creature’s front is a circular opening that leads into its interior. An anemone attacks any creature that swims into its many tendrils with a paralytic poison that immobilizes prey so it can be swallowed whole. A victim caught in the tendrils can save to resist the paralysis. If a creature fails, the anemone swallows the prey whole in the next round. If provoked, an anemone ejects the contents of its stomach in an acidic cloud that deals 1d8 damage to all creatures within 20 feet for 1d3 rounds.

- Anemone, Great (Giant) Sea: **HD** 11; **AC** 8 \[11\]; **Atk** tendrils (paralysis); **Save** 4; **Move** 0 (immobile); **AL** N; **CL/XP** 13/2300; **Special**: Acid cloud, swallow whole

### Angels

Angels are a race of celestials native to the lawfully-aligned outer planes.

#### Angel, Chalkydri

This angelic figure resembles a muscular humanoid with coppery skin and eyes. It has four large feathery, white wings and carries a longsword swathed in fire. Chalkydri take their role as protectors of good very seriously, and shift planes with ease, jumping from one reality to the next to do so. They are powerful spell casters (at will—*bless*, *detect evil*, *dispel magic*, *invisibility* (self only), *polymorph self*, *remove curse*, *cure disease*, *see invisible*; 3/day—*cure serious* *wounds*, *flame strike*; 1/day—*restoration*, *raise dead*)

- Angel, Chalkydri: **HD** 9; **AC** 0 \[19\]; **Atk** +2 flaming long sword (1d8+2 + 1d6 fire); **Save** 7; **Move** 9 (Fly 18); **AL** L; **CL/XP** 11/1700; **Special**: Plane shift, spells

**Angel, Chalkydri** from the [Tome of Horrors Complete](http://shop.d20pfsrd.com/products/sw-the-tome-of-horrors-complete), Copyright 2011, Necromancer Games, Inc., published and distributed by Frog God Games; Author Scott Greene.

#### Angel, Empyreal

Empyreals are powerful angelic warriors about 9 feet tall with silver hair, blue eyes and dressed in shining armor. They have large, feathery, silver wings and milk-white skin. Empyreals are fiery, quick-tempered, and forceful, but always fair. To non-Lawful beings and Lawful creatures with fewer HD, the empyreal appears as a column of white fire. Once per day, an empyreal can increase its radiance to deal 8d6 damage to creatures within 60 feet, and blind them for 3d6 minutes (save for half damage, avoid blindness). An empyreal also radiates an aura in a 30-foot-radius that forces Chaotic creatures to save before they can attack the angel. This aura grants Lawful creatures a -2\[+2\] armor bonus.

Empyreals have a number of spell-like abilities: at will—*continual light*, *detect evil*, *dispel magic*, *invisibility* (self only), *remove curse*; 2/day—*blade barrier*, *cure disease*, *cure serious wounds*; 1/day—*resurrection*, *raise dead*. Many can also cast spells as an 8th-level Cleric

- Angel, Empyreal: **HD** 12; **AC** -1 \[20\]; **Atk** 1 weapon (2d6); **Save** 3; **Move** 15 (Fly 25); **AL** L; **CL/XP** 15/2900; **Special**: Radiant blast; immune to acid, cold and petrification; resists electricity and fire; spell-like abilities

#### Angel, Monadic Deva

Monadic devas are angels with silvery wings that patrol the Ethereal and Elemental planes. They serve as leaders and officers in celestial armies. Monadic devas wield two *maces +3/+5 vs. constructed creatures*. They are immune to acid and cold damage and death effects and suffer only half damage from electricity and fire. Monadic devas can use the following spells: *charm elemental* (per *charm monster*, but only affects elementals), *continual light*, *cure disease*, *cure light wounds* (7/day), *detect evil*, *dispel magic*, *hold monster* (1/day), *holy word*, *invisibility* (self only), *mirror image* (7/day), *polymorph self* and *remove curse*.

- Angel, Monadic Deva: **HD** 10; **AC** -2 \[21\]; **Atk** 2 weapons (3d6); **Save** 5; **Move** 18 (Fly 36); **AL** L; **CL/XP** 18/3500; **Special**: Immunities, +1 weapon to hit, magic resistance (60%), magical abilities

#### Angel, Movanic Deva

Movanic devas resemble broad-shouldered humans with silver hair, white eyes, and large feathery silver wings. Relatives of the monadic devas, they are usually found wandering the Positive or Negative Energy Planes or the Material Plane. Movanic devas directly aid powerful mortals when evil threatens the balance of the planes. In the celestial armies, movanic devas serve as soldiers.

Movanic devas wield *+1 flaming greatswords*. Animals do not willingly attack movanic devas, and plant creatures cannot and do not attack them unless attacked first. Movanic devas can shift between planes at will. They can also use the following spells: *Anti-magic shell* (3/day)*, continual light, cure disease, cure light wounds* (7/day), *detect evil, dispel magic, invisibility* (self only), *plane shift, polymorph self, protection from normal missiles* (1/day) and *remove curse.*

- Angel, Movanic Deva: **HD** 8; **AC** -1 \[20\]; **Atk** weapon (3d6); **Save** 8; **Move** 18 (Fly 36); **AL** L; **CL/XP** 15/2900; **Special**: Immunities, +1 weapon to hit, magic resistance (55%), magical abilities

### Animal Lords

For every animal species, there is a single ruler or lord, looked upon by those animals as a minor deity of sorts. The animal lord is the master of that species; for example, there is a fox lord, mouse lord, and a cat lord. Each animal can assume two forms: human and animal. Its animal form is always of a member of the species it represents. Animal lords are seen as protectors of nature and animals. They may step in and prevent hunters from destroying a race of animals or foresters from completely decimating a forest. They do not, however, interfere with nature itself (i.e., animals die, they are killed for food or clothing)—such is the way of the universe.

#### Animal Lord, Cat Lord

There is only one. The Cat Lord is the Lord of All Felines. His natural form is that of a black panther with dark, ruby eyes. He can assume a human form, and in this form, he appears as a dark-skinned human with black hair, chiseled features, and ruby eyes. In human form, he almost always dresses in black. The Cat Lord spends his days roaming the planes. The Cat Lord can speak the secret language of druids.

When the Cat Lord howls, all creatures except felines within a 20-foot spread must succeed on a saving throw or be stunned for 1d2 rounds. Once every 1d4 rounds the Cat Lord can spit a line of caustic saliva at a single target to a range of 30 feet. A creature hit must succeed on a saving throw or be blinded.

Twice per day, the Cat Lord can automatically summon 1d4+2 lions or tigers, 1d4+4 leopards or cheetahs, 1d2 smilodons, 1d2 weretigers, or 30 + 1d20 (normal) cats. No felines, including chimeras, caterwauls, sea cats, kamadans, tabaxis or feline lycanthropes willingly attack the Cat Lord. The Cat Lord can speak to all such creatures.

Nine times per day, the Cat Lord can lick his wounds, curing 2d4 points of damage. The Cat Lord can use the following spells: *Astral spell* (1/day), *detect evil, dimension door, ethereality* (2/day, as the potion), *haste* (2/day, self only), *invisibility* and *teleport* (1/day).

The Cat Lord sees five times as well as a human in shadowy illumination and normal light and can leap up to 30 feet forward, backward or laterally with minimal effort. The Cat Lord can communicate telepathically at a range of 100 feet.

- Cat Lord: **HD** 19; **AC** -5 \[24\]; **Atk** 2 claws (2d6) and bite (1d6); **Save** 3; **Move** 24 (Climb 12); **AL** N; **CL/XP** 26/6200; **Special**: Change shape, howl, lick wounds, magic resistance (95%), magical abilities, immune to mind-affecting effects, surprise on 1-4 on 1d6, +1 or better weapon to hit

#### Animal Lord, Mouse Lord

**Special**: Change shape, disease, magic resistance (95%), magical abilities, immune to mind-affecting effects (including illusions), surprise on 1-5 on 1d6, +1 or better weapon to hit

Like the Cat Lord, there is only one Mouse Lord, and she is the Lord (or Lady) of all rodents. Her natural form is that of a large black-furred dire rat with copper eyes. She can assume a human form and this form is almost always of a female with darkened skin, raven-black hair, and copper eyes. She dresses in robes of flowing silver or gray. The Mouse Lord spends her days roaming the planes. She can speak the secret language of druids.

The Mouse Lord’s bite causes black fever, which kills in 1d3 days unless cured.

Twice per day, the Mouse Lord can automatically summon 10-100 rats or mice, 2d8 brain rats* or shadow rats*, 2d6 dire rats or barics*, or 1d4 dire shadow rats*, ethereal rats*, or wererats, or 1d4+1 rat swarms. The Mouse Lord can speak to all of these creatures, and none of these creatures will willingly attack the Mouse Lord, although they can be compelled to do so using magic.

The Mouse Lord sees four times as well as a human in shadowy illumination and twice as well in normal light.

The Mouse Lord can use the following spells: *Astral spell* (1/day)*, confusion*, *detect evil, ethereality* (2/day, as the potion), *teleport* (1/day).

*\* These creatures may be found in this book.*

- Mouse Lord: **HD** 15; **AC** -5 \[24\]; **Atk** Bite (2d6 + disease); **Save** 3; **Move** 24 (Climb 12); **AL** N; **CL/XP** 21/4700; **Special**: Change shape, disease, magic resistance (95%), magical abilities, immune to mind-affecting effects (including illusions), surprise on 1-5 on 1d6, +1 or better weapon to hit

### Animated Objects

Animated objects generally do not have minds of their own, being animated by a spell rather than by a spirit of some kind.They may follow programmed instructions, or might follow the orders of a master if the master is actually present. Since there are so many possible types of objects, and so many different ways in which an object might be animated, the exact details of the object are left to the Referee. Two examples are provided, although even with animated chairs and tables the exact details can (and should) occasionally differ.

#### Animated Carpet

This version of an animated carpet attacks for no damage, but if the target is hit and fails a saving throw, the carpet holds the character, struggling, until a saving throw is successful.

- Animated Carpet: **HD** 1; **AC** 9 \[10\]; **Atk** 1 (no damage); **Move** 6; **Save** 17; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 1/15; **Special**: Grab.

#### Animated Chair

This version of an animated chair bumps against its opponents, with a successful hit causing the target to fall to the ground and take 1hp damage.

- Animated Chair: **HD** 1; **AC** 8 \[11\]; **Atk** 1 bump (save or fall); **Move** 12; **Save** 18; **AL N; CL/XP** 1/15; **Special**: Knocks over.

### Ankheg

Ankhegs are huge insects, 10 to 20ft long, resembling grasshoppers with vicious mandibles. They burrow through the ground, often in farmlands as well as in caverns. Once per day, an ankheg can squirt digestive acids for 5d6 points of damage (save for half), but this is a defense not used in normal hunting.

- Ankheg 3 HD: **HD** 3; **AC** 2 \[17\] underside 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 1 bite (3d6); **Move** 12 (burrow 6); **Save** 14; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 4/120XP; **Special**: Spits acid 5d6 (1/day, save for half)
- Ankheg 4 HD: **HD** 4; **AC** 2 \[17\] underside 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 1 bite (3d6); **Move** 12 (burrow 6); **Save** 13; **AL N; CL/XP** 5/240XP; **Special**: Spits acid 5d6 (1/day, save for half)
- Ankheg 5 HD: **HD** 5; **AC** 2 \[17\] underside 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 1 bite (3d6); **Move** 12 (burrow 6); **Save** 12; **AL N; CL/XP** 6/400XP; **Special**: Spits acid 5d6 (1/day, save for half)
- Ankheg 6 HD: **HD** 6; **AC** 2 \[17\] underside 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 1 bite (3d6); **Move** 12 (burrow 6); **Save** 11; **AL N; CL/XP** 7/600XP; **Special**: Spits acid 5d6 (1/day, save for half)
- Ankheg 7 HD: **HD** 7; **AC** 2 \[17\] underside 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 1 bite (3d6); **Move** 12 (burrow 6); **Save** 9; **AL N; CL/XP** 8/800XP; **Special**: Spits acid 5d6 (1/day, save for half)
- Ankheg 8 HD: **HD** 8; **AC** 2 \[17\] underside 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 1 bite (3d6); **Move** 12 (burrow 6); **Save** 8; **AL N; CL/XP** 9/1100XP; **Special**: Spits acid 5d6 (1/day, save for half).

### Ant, Giant

Giant ants live in vast subterranean hives tunneled through soil and even stone. A hive can hold as many as 100 ants, in a worker-to-warrior ratio of 5:1. The poison of a warrior ant does 2d6 points of damage if a saving throw is failed, 1d4 points of damage if the saving throw succeeds.

#### Ant, Giant (Worker)

[Giant Ant](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Ant-Giant) (Worker): **HD**: 2; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** Bite (1d6); **Save** 16; **Move** 18; **AL N;** **CL/XP** 2/30

#### Ant, Giant (Warrior)

The poison of a warrior ant does 2d6 points of damage if a saving throw is failed, 1d4 points of damage if the saving throw succeeds.

[Giant Ant](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Ant-Giant) (Warrior): **HD**: 3; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** Bite (1d6 + poison); **Save** 14; **Move** 18; **AL N;** **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: Poison 2d6 (save for 1d4 only).

#### Ant, Giant (Queen)

The queen of a [giant ant](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Ant-Giant) colony is larger, tougher, and slower than the average [giant ant](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Ant-Giant).

[Giant Ant](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Ant-Giant) (Queen): **HD**: 10; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** Bite (1d6); **Save** 5; **Special** None; **Move** 3; **AL N;** **CL/XP** 8/800

### Ant Lion

The ant lion is a vicious insect-like creature that resembles a giant gray or brown ant with leathery skin covered in coarse, black bristles. Its deep, inset eyes are black and its mouth is filled with rows of jagged teeth. Two large silver mandibles protrude just above its mouth. Each mandible has a barb on its inside midway between the creature’s mouth and the end point of the mandible. The ant lion lurks in the bottom of pits and holes feeding on those unfortunates that fall in.

Ant lions dig deep, funnel-shaped pits in which to trap their prey. An ant lion pit is about 60 feet across and about 20 feet deep. A creature that steps on the pit must succeed at saving throw or slip and fall down into the center of the funnel. It is there the ant lion waits, buried just under the surface of the ground. When prey falls to the center of the funnel, the ant lion surfaces and attacks, using its mandibles to grab and tear its prey. An ant lion that gets a hold does not release its prey until either it or the prey is dead.

- Ant Lion: **HD** 8; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** Bite (2d8); **Save** 8; **Move** 12 (Burrow 6); **AL** N; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: Trap

**Ant Lion** from the [Tome of Horrors Complete](http://shop.d20pfsrd.com/products/sw-the-tome-of-horrors-complete), Copyright 2011, Necromancer Games, Inc., published and distributed by Frog God Games; Author Scott Greene, based on original material by Gary Gygax.

### Ape, Flying

Flying apes are somewhat larger and more muscular than gorillas. Most have bat wings, but some have feathered bird-wings. If a flying ape hits with both arms, it can either rend its foe for an additional 1d6 points of damage or gain a good enough hold to carry the foe into the air (to drop later, or deliver the victim to an evil overlord, as applicable). As with gorillas, most flying apes are of far less than human intelligence, but more intelligent (and often chaotic) ones are not uncommon.

- Flying Ape: **HD** 5; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 2 hands (1d4), 1 bite (1d6); **Move** 9 (fly 18); **Save** 12; **AL** N (or C) **CL/XP** 6/400; **Special**: Rend or carry airborne.

### Ape, Gorilla

If a gorilla hits with both arms, it will crush and rend the victim for an additional 1d6 points of damage. Some gorillas, especially those living near places of eerie magic, might become carnivorous and seek out human prey with abnormal cunning and rudimentary intelligence. Such carnivorous apes would be of chaotic alignment.

- Gorilla: **HD** 4; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 2 hands (1d3), 1 bite (1d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 13; **CL/XP** 4/120; **AL** N; **Special**: Hug and rend.

### Apparition

Apparitions are undead spirits of creatures that died as the result of an accident. The twist of fate that ended their life prematurely has driven them totally and completely to the side of evil. An apparition is often mistaken for a ghost or spectre. Apparitions hate all living creatures and attack them on sight. Apparitions are ethereal creatures and they exist mainly on the Ethereal Plane.

An apparition has no physical attacks and attacks by fear alone. By implanting a *suggestion* in a victim’s mind, it attempts to actually scare the life out of its opponent. Once the apparition selects a target, it shifts into the Material Plane and uses its *spectral strangulation* ability. If the target fails a saving throw made to disbelieve in the attack, it dies of fright. If the target succeeds at the saving throw, they are merely affected by the *fear* spell. Any humanoid slain by an apparition becomes an apparition in 1d4 hours. Apparitions are utterly powerless in natural sunlight and flee from it. An apparition caught in sunlight cannot attack.

- Apparition: **HD** 8; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** Spectral strangulation (see text); **Save** 8; **Move** 12 (Fly 24); **AL** C; **CL/XP** 9/1100; **Special**: Strangulation, detect living, incorporeal, sunlight powerlessness

### Aqueous Orb

Aqueous orbs are bubble creatures that levitate above the surface of the water, leaving a long, tube-like feeding tail dangling into the water below. Liquid and nutrients are pulled up through the tail to the bubble-like body, which thrives on rotting carrion in the surrounding water. An aqueous orb glows with green luminescence when attacking: those who fail a saving throw will walk toward the orb, enter the water, and most likely drown. The feeding-tail can also be used as a weapon, piercing foes for 1d4 hit points of damage and inflicting 1d4 points of damage automatically thereafter, as it sucks blood from the victim. An aqueous orb is immune to all but piercing weapons; the feeding-tail is immune to all but slashing weapons. *(Author: Matt Finch).*

- Aqueous Orb: **HD** 3; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 1 feeding-tail (1d4); **Save** 15; **Move** 3; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Sucks blood, luminescence, immune to weapon types.

### Arach

This six-armed humanoid has a lithe build and stands just under seven feet tall. They have narrow aquiline faces and bony plates protruding from their thoraxes and limbs. Arach inject a poison with their bite, and may coat their weapons with the same substance. About 30% of arach are spell casters, able to cast spells as a 6th-level Magic-user.

- Arach: **HD** 8; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 6 slams (1d6) or 6 short swords (1d6), 1 bite (1d4 plus poison); **Save** 8; **Move** 12 (Climb 6); **AL** C; **CL/XP** 9/1100; **Special**:Poison, summon spiders, spells

### Aranea

An aranea is an intelligent, shapechanging spider with sorcerous powers. In its natural form, an aranea resembles a big spider, with a humpbacked body a little bigger than a human torso. It has fanged mandibles like a normal spider. Two small arms, each about 2 feet long, lie below the mandibles. Each arm has a hand with four many-jointed fingers and a double-jointed thumb. An aranea weighs about 150 pounds. A hump on its back houses its brain.

Aranea can cast webs at a single opponent at a range up to 40ft (saving throw). The victim is entangled, but can break free within 1d6 rounds. These horrid creatures are spellcasters, able to cast one second level and two first level magic-user spells. Usually, an aranea is prepared with 2 *charm person* spells and a *mirror image* spell; or, alternatively, with 1 *charm person,* 1 *sleep* spell, and *invisibility*.

- Aranea: **HD** 4; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d6 + poison); **Move** 12; **Save** 13; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 7/600; **Special**: Webs, Spells.

### Arcanix

Arcanixes (also known as Spell-Stealers), resemble tall, gaunt humans with bluish skin and pointed ears. They are extraplanar creatures that foray into the mortal realms in their obsessive search for magic. They prize magical items above all else, but spellbooks and arcane lore (as well as spellcasters themselves) are also sought to take back to their home plane.

There are three types of Arcanix: **Arcanix Minor** (3HD), **Arcanix Major** (6HD) and **Arcanix Greater** (12HD). If an arcanix is encountered bearing a weapon, it is a near certainty that the weapon is magical in nature (the referee should base the weapon in accordance with the type of arcanix).

An arcanix that can successfully touch a spell-caster may steal spell levels up to its own number of hit dice. Example: An Arcanix Minor (3HD) may steal a third level spell from a magic-user, or three 1st level spells, or a 2nd and a 1st level spell. The spell-caster is allowed a saving throw to negate this effect. If the attack is successful (and the save fails) the stolen spells leave the magic-user’s memory (until he can re-memorize them again), and the arcanix may use them as if he had memorized them. The number of times per day that an Arcanix may use this ability depends on the type of Arcanix; Minor 1/day, Major 3/day, Greater 6/day.

Arcanixes possess the following spell-like Abilities: Detect Magic 3/day, Read Magic 3/day, Dispel Magic 2/day, Dimension Door 1/day. An arcanix may teleport to or from its home plane once (3HD), twice (6HD), or 3 times (12HD) per week.

### Arcanoplasm

Arcanoplasms resemble giant pale yellow amoebas with “veins” of dark gray striping. Arcanoplasms are “tuned” to arcane magic and can detect magic-users within 100 feet. They can mimic any 5th-level or lower magic-user spell cast within 30 feet on their next action. Any arcane spell cast is automatically absorbed to heal 1 point for every 3 points of damage otherwise done (non-damaging spells heal 1 point per spell level of the spell). Spells that affect an area are not absorbed, but also don’t affect the arcanoplasm. Cleric spells affect the ooze normally. Arcanoplasms are immune to poison, *sleep* effects, paralysis and polymorph.

- Arcanoplasm: **HD** 5; **AC** 8 \[11\]; **Atk** 1 acid slam (2d4 plus 1d6 acid + grab); **Save** 12; **Move** 3; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: acid (1d6), absorb spells, spell mimicry, immunities

### Archer Bush

The archer bush is a subterranean, semi-mobile plant that looks like a small mound of brownish-green leaves with pale buds of gold and purple. It takes sustenance from the blood of living creatures. Hidden beneath its trunk is the archer bush’s mouth, which appears to be nothing more than a dark recess or cavity. It attacks by firing a cluster of thorns at a single creature that comes within 20 feet of its location. These thorns inflict 1d8 points of damage and impose a -1 penalty to hit and to saving throws until removed.

- Archer Bush: **HD** 2; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** Thorns (1d8); **Save** 16; **Move** 3; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 2/30; **Special**: Thorns

### Archer-Tree

Archer-trees are a species of walking pine tree. Some of the tree’s needles are extremely long, although this is not easy to notice from afar. The tree’s animated branches can throw 1d4 of these longer needles per round to a range of 100ft. The needles contain a sedative poison that paralyzes victims for 3d6 turns (saving throw negates).

- Archer-Tree: **HD** 7; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 1d4 needles (1d6 + paralyze); **Move** 1; **Save** 9; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: Paralysis.

### Artificer of Yothri

The artificers of Yothri are tall and skeletal, a construction of dark-hued metalloid bones acting as the framework for artificial tubes and organs. They wear hoods and long, black robes – perhaps a necessity of the dead world they inhabit in a distant and eroding reality. Their palaces are of baroque green glass and alien metals, twisting in unnatural shapes, domes, and bubbles. The artificers are mutually hostile, each coveting the others’ resources and knowledge. It is remotely possible that player characters might be kidnapped to serve an artificer by attacking the citadel of one of the others in the barren, suppurating wastelands of Yothri itself.

An artificer employs the Science of Yothri, which is a mix of psychic powers, magic, and technology impossible to achieve outside the physical realities of Yothri itself. Rather than manifesting in spells, the Science of Yothri allows the Artificer to use certain powers, some mental, some magical, as follows:

**Psychic powers**: at will, (in conjunction with a physical attack if desired), the artificer can use telekinesis to lift up to 300 pounds of weight, create or maintain a “double vision” effect similar to a single mirror image per the spell, increase magic resistance to 80%, maintain a mental connection with an amphoron in another plane, or work to establish a connection with an amphoron in another plane (the mental connection with amphorons is described below).

**Magical powers**: in conjunction with a psychic power (but not with physical attacks), the Artificer may create one of the following effects using the Science of Yothri: (1) once per day, the Artificer can cast charm person in a cone shape 60ft long and reaching 60ft wide at extreme range, (2) three times per day, the Artificer can cast a spell to cause metal poisoning in the target’s bloodstream (a saving throw applies), rendering the victim helpless with pain and causing death within 2d6 rounds unless the poison is counteracted. (*Author: Matt Finch; first appeared in [Knockspell Magazine #1](http://shop.d20pfsrd.com/collections/knockspell-magazine/products/knockspell-issue-1))*

- Artificer of Yothri: **HD** 10; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** claw (1d10+1); **Save** 5; **Move** 15; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 14/2600; **Special**: Magic Resistance 50% (80%), psychic powers, magic powers.

### Ascomoid

Ascomoids are subterranean fungus monsters that exist on a diet of living creatures. They appear as 10-ft. diameter brownish-green puffballs pocked by small dots that function as sensory organs. Ascomoids feed by sitting atop a slain creature and absorbing its body fluids into its own form. Creatures slain in this manner appear as rotting husks. Ascomoids generally avoid light and the surface world, though they have no adverse reaction to sunlight or bright light. They attack by rolling over its opponents or slamming into them. Creatures that are run over or slammed must pass a saving throw or be knocked prone. Ascomoids can also fire spores at attackers. The spores have a range of 30-ft. and billow into a cloud with a 20-ft. radius and 20-ft. height. Creatures caught in the cloud must pass a saving throw or suffer 2d6 points of damage. All creatures, whether they save or not, are blinded and nauseated for 1d4 rounds.

- Ascomoid: **HD** 6; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** Run over or slam (1d8); **Save** 11; **Move** 15; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: Run over, spores, resistance to blunt weapons, fire and electricity (50%)

### Asrai

An asrai is a 1-foot tall female fey with long golden hair, slightly pointed elf-like ears and pale blue skin. Her eyes are emerald or gold and her features are delicate. Male asrai are thought to exist, though none have ever been encountered. Asrai can’t leave their watery homes for more than an hour. An asrai’s touch chills opponents for 1d6 points of damage. Asrai cast spells as 5th-level Magic-Users. Twice per day, they can also cast *create water* and *obscuring mist.*

- Asrai: **HD** 1; **AC** 8 \[11\]; **Atk** 1 cold touch (1d6); **Save** 17; **Move** 12 (Swim 24); **AL** N; **CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**: Chill touch, spells, water dependent

### Assassin Bug, Giant

A giant assassin bug has a narrow head ending in a segmented beak or proboscis. The 5-foot-tall creature’s carapace is dull brownish-black and its front jackknife legs are covered in thousands of small hairs. Two long segmented antennae jut from its head. Assassin bugs are predatory insects that feed on the blood and tissue of living creatures. An assassin bug has two pairs of wings that it keeps folded against its back when not using them to fly. The bite of an assassin bug injects a corrosive poison that liquefies its prey’s insides (save to resist).

- Asrai: **HD** 6; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d6) and 1 bite (1d8 + liquefy organ); **Save** 11; **Move** 9 (Climb 6, Fly 12); **AL** N; **CL/XP 8/80**0; **Special**: Liquefy organs

### Assassin Vine

The assassin vine is a semi-mobile plant that collects its own grisly fertilizer by grabbing and crushing animals and depositing the carcasses near its roots. A mature plant consists of a main vine, about 20 feet long. Smaller vines, up to 5 feet long, branch off from the main vine about every 6 inches.

An assassin vine can move about, albeit very slowly, but usually stays put unless it needs to seek prey in a new vicinity.

An assassin vine growing underground usually generates enough offal to support a thriving colony of mushrooms and other fungi, which spring up around the plant and help conceal it.

An assassin vine can animate plants in the near vicinity (about 30ft), and these plants will immobilize anyone failing a saving throw.

- [Assassin Vine](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Assassin-Vine): **HD** 7; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 1 vine (1d6+1); **Move** 1; **Save** 9; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: Animate plants.

### Astral Moth

Astral moths are large, moth-like creatures with the bizarre ability to carry other creatures between planes of existence, or into other dimensions. The origins of these rare creatures are lost in the sands of time, but three varieties are now known. The dark and the white varieties are both semi-intelligent, the dark-colored moths being Chaotic in alignment and the white ones being aligned with Law. There is also a grey variety which is apparently closer to the original breeding stock, having only animal intelligence and a Neutral alignment. All three varieties are capable of planar travel, taking their instructions by means of a rudimentary mental telepathy. Poorly trained and untrained astral moths may attempt to throw off a rider mid-journey, which is a significant hazard.

Once an astral moth is airborne, it can begin flying into the spaces between realities on the way to other planes of existence or other dimensions. The time required for such travel will vary in accordance with the intended destination.

The creatures themselves are relatively harmless; the threat of an astral moth is whatever strange being might be riding it as a mount. Astral moths have been used by many ancient, non-human civilizations existing in different times, planes, or dimensions. They are, of course, greatly prized by wizards, and the egg of an astral moth is worth 5,000 gp if sold. Capturing a wild adult is possible, but care must be taken in order to keep it from getting airborne: if the creature is able to take wing, it will escape into the unknown dimensions. *(Author: Matt Finch)*

- Astral Moth: **HD** 4-2; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d6); **Move** 3/90 (flying); **Save** 13; **AL** (any); **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Dimensional Flight.

### Astral Shark

Astral sharks are sleek, piscean creatures with blotchy skin of sickly white and pink. They measure between 12 and 30 feet in length. Astral sharks have jagged, slightly curved dorsal fins and large, bulbous, lidless eyes that show no trace of pity. Astral sharks dwell on the Astral Plane, sitting atop that weird dimension’s food chain. They seem to be drawn to the strange energies of visitors to the Astral Plane, relishing the silver cords that connect an astral traveler to its material body. Astral sharks can detect the presence of an astral traveler within 180 feet. When such a traveler is detected, it streaks toward them and begins to circle, darting in to bite with its powerful jaws. On a roll of a natural 20, the astral shark manages to sever the traveler’s astral cord, destroying its material body and astral form.

- Astral Shark: **HD** 8; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** Bite (1d8); **Save** 8; **Move 24**; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 9/1100; **Special**: Astral scent, sever silver cord

### Athatch

The offspring of a demon and a giant, an athatch is a monster about 14ft tall, weighing about 2 tons, with 1d3 eyes, 1d3 arms, and 1d3 legs. An odd-numbered eye is located in its forehead, an odd-numbered arm is located in the middle of its chest, and an odd-numbered leg is located behind its haunch. It is ambidextrous (if it has two or more arms) and can wield a weapon in any or all of its hands. They use massive weapons, usually great clubs (2d6 damage). An athatch cannot normally bite opponents man-sized or smaller in melee, but may (if victory seems likely) toy with its victims by grasping and lifting an opponent with a free hand (a to-hit roll is still required) and then biting on the following round. The poisonous spit of the athatch requires a saving throw at -2 or the victim becomes helplessly nauseated for 1d3 turns; the athatch also can spit this poison up to 10ft.

Because of their demonic heritage, athatch have 60-ft. darkvision and the following spell-like abilities they can use once per hour: darkness (5-ft. radius), levitate, and phantasmal force. Once per day an athatch can polymorph self into the form of another giant. They subtract 1 point of damage per die from cold, fire, gas, and lightning attacks against them. *(Author: Scott Casper).*

- [Athatch](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Athatch): **HD** 11; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 1 or 2 weapons (3d6 or 2d6/2d6)/1 bite (1d6+1); **Move** 15; **Save** 4; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 15/2900; **Special**: Poison (nausea) spit, darkness, levitate, phantasmal force, reduced damage from cold, fire, gas, electricity, polymorph into other [giant](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Giants) type.

### Atomie

Atomies are among the smallest of the fey, looking like 1-foot tall elves with gangly limbs and greenish skin. They dwell in arboreal regions, with a single atomie family staking their claim to a single tree. Atomies are attractive, especially when compared to other sprites. Atomie clothing is almost always magical, made to change color with the seasons to help hide the wearer during all times of the year. Atomies can cast the following spells: *Blink*, *entangle*, *invisibility* (self), *pass without trace* and *speak with animals*.

- Atomie: **HD** 1d3; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** Weapon (1d3); **Save** 18; **Move** 15 (Fly 24); **AL** N; **CL/XP** 2/30; **Special**:Spells, magic resistance (20%), surprise on 1-2 on 1d6

### Aurumvorax (Golden Gorger)

The aurumvorax (also called the golden gorger) is an extremely vicious creature that resembles an 8-legged badger with bright, golden fur. Only 3 feet long, aurumvoraces are extremely territorial, coming together only rarely to mate. The aurumvorax attacks by biting a foe and holding on with its powerful jaws. Victims of the creature’s bite attack must pass a saving throw to avoid being held in jaws and raked with four claw attacks, each inflicting 1d4 points of damage. Aurumvorax feed on gold, devouring the coins and using the gold to strengthen their bones and stiffen their bristles. The pelt and bones of the animal are worth 2,000 gp.

- Aurumvorax: **HD** 12; **AC** 0 \[19\]; **Atk** Bite (1d8); **Save** 3; **Move** 12 (Burrow 3); **AL** N; **CL/XP** 13/2300; **Special**: Rake with claws, surprise on 1-2 on 1d6, resistance to fire (50%), immunity to poison

### Azer

Azers are dwarflike beings native to the Elemental Plane of Fire. They wear kilts of brass, bronze, or copper, and bear broad-headed spears or well-crafted hammers in combat. Their attacks deal +1 damage due to their intense heat. They are immune to fire damage. Stats are for the normal azer; sergeants and leaders can be much larger and will have more hit dice.

- [Azer](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Azer): **HD** 2; **AC** 2(17); **Atk** 1 weapon (1d6+1); **Save** 16; **Move** 12; **AL** L; **CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**: +1 heat damage, immune to fire.

## B

### Babbler

Babblers are tall creatures that appear to a cross between a lizardman and a gorgosaurus. They have yellow scales, grey underbellies, and large, strong tails that keep them balanced when they stand on their hind legs. Most of their time is spent slithering on their stomach in search of prey. The babbler is a carnivore and is quite fond of human, elven, and dwarven flesh. They speak their own weird, gutteral language and understand Common but cannot speak it. A babbler making a surprise attack enjoys a +2 bonus to hit and damage.

- Babbler: **HD** 5; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d6) and bite (1d8); **Save** 12; **Move** 15 (Bipedal 9); **AL** C; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Surprise on 1-4 on 1d6

### Baboon

Baboons are vicious pack hunters, usually led by a stronger-than-normal alpha male. They might be susceptible to the influence of ancient and evil powers. Giant baboons stand 8ft tall on two legs, about twice the size of a normal baboon. As with normal baboons, they are susceptible to the influence of ancient and evil powers.

- [Baboon](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Baboon): **HD** 1; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d4); **Move** 12; **Save** 17; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 1/15; **Special**: None.

### Baccae

Baccae are attractive women with long flowing, rich, red hair and emerald green eyes. They wear billowy white robes emblazoned with archaic symbols and runes and stand between 5 and 6 feet tall and weigh around 120 to 130 pounds. When enraged or intoxicated, baccae become beastlike and attack with weapons, fangs and claws. When in human form, any creature withon 30 feet meeting their gaze must save or be charmed (as per the spell).

- Baccae: **HD** 3; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d6) and 1 bite (1d4) or 1 weapon (1d10) and 1 bite (1d6); **Save** 14; **Move** 6; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: beast form, charming gaze

### Badger, Giant

These subterranean predators are the size of a full-grown [human](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Humans), and quite aggressive when defending their territory. Young Giant Badgers have 1HD.

- [Giant Badger](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Badger-Giant): **HD** 3; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 2 Claws (1d3), bite (1d6); **Move** 6; **Save** 14; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**: None.

### Bag of Teeth

A bag of teeth is a deceptive-looking little critter. At first glance, the creature looks like a pouch of coins. Its insides, seen when one opens the “pouch”, resemble coins of gold. As one inserts his hand within the creature to retrieve the gold within, the critter’s razor-sharp teeth spring open around the pouches opening, and clamp down on the victim’s wrist. The bite causes 1d6 points of damage and holds on, with 1d6+1 hp being lost automatically each subsequent round until the vicious creature is killed and lets go. *(Author: Skathros).*

- [Bag of Teeth](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Bag-of-Teeth): **HD** 1; **AC** 9 \[10\]; **Atk** Bite (1d6+1/round); **Save** 17; **Move** 0; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 1/15; **Special**: Bites and holds.

### Banderlog

The banderlog is a somewhat intelligent baboon-like primate with grayish-brown fur that makes its home in warm forests and jungles. Though it appears as a larger version of the common baboon, it does not keep company with or associate with normal baboons. Banderlogs’ intelligence allows them to form small tribal communities for protection and companionship. The leader of such a community is usually the largest and strongest banderlog of the tribe. Banderlogs sustain themselves on a diet of fruits and nuts, with coconuts being their favorite food. Though omnivorous, they rarely eat meat of any sort. Unaggressive unless threatened, banderlogs prefer to attack from a distance using small rocks or coconuts. They can hurl these projectiles up to 50 feet.

- Banderlog: **HD** 4; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** Bite (1d6) or club (1d6) or coconut (1d4); **Save** 13; **Move** 15 (Climb 12); **AL** N; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: Coconut throwing

### Banshee

Banshees are horrid faerie (or undead) creatures that live in swamps and other desolate places. Their shriek (once per day) necessitates a saving throw versus death or the hearer will die in 2d6 rounds. They can travel over water and other terrain as if it were land, but crossing running water causes them to lose their magic resistance for 3d6 hours. They look like gaunt humans (male or female) with long, stringy hair and glowing yellow eyes. They often wear hooded cloaks. At the Referee’s discretion, such creatures might be undead rather than faerie-folk, and are considered Type 9 undead for turning purposes.

- [Banshee](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Banshee): **HD** 7; **AC** 0 \[19\]; **Atk** 1 claw (1d8); **Move** (fly 12); **Save** 9; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 11/1700; **Special**: Magic or silver to hit; magic resistance 49%; shriek of death; Immune to enchantments

### Baobhan Sith

A baobhan sith appears as female elf with pearl white skin, golden or brown hair, and eyes of emerald, blue or hazel. Her figure is sleek and curved and she moves with a cat-like grace. By entrancing creatures with their dance, they lure men to their deaths. Those who see her dance must make a save, or become enthralled for 2d4 rounds. Once a target is captivated, the baobhan sith moves in and drains its blood with a bite (1d4 points of damage). When slain, the baobhan sith curses her killers with her dying words. At will, baobhan sith can *detect thoughts* and cast *plant growth* and *suggestion*.

- Baobhan Sith: **HD** 2; **AC** 9 \[10\]; **Atk** 1 slam (1d4) and 1 bite (1d4); **Save** 14; **Move** 15; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 6/400; **Special**: Blood drain, captivating dance, dying words, spell-like abilities

### Barbegazi (Ice Gnome)

Barbegazis – also known as ice gnomes – stand about 3-1/2 feet tall and have white hair and long flowing whitish-blue beards that appear to be made of icicles. Their skin is pale and glossy-white and their eyes are deep blue. They have large, flat feet and never wear shoes. They are perfectly adapted to live in the coldest regions, and can walk on deep snow without being slowed. Once per day, a barbegazi can cause metal to freeze using a variation of *heat metal*. They are also able to shoot shards of ice from their hands (cold variation of *burning hands*, 1/day) to stop attackers.

- Barbegazi: **HD** 2; **AC** 8 \[11\]; **Atk** 1 weapon (1d4); **Save** 16; **Move** 9; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**: Spell-like abilities, snow move, immune to cold, fire vulnerability

### Baric

Barics look like giant 6-legged rats with black fur and yellow eyes. They have long, duck-like bills lined with rows of needle-like teeth. The average baric is 3 feet long and weighs 50 pounds, though they can grow to a length of 7 feet and weigh about 150 pounds. Some races keep barics as pets, though more often than not, these unpredictable monsters turn on their masters within a short time of entering captivity.

- Baric: **HD** 2; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d3) and bite (1d8); **Save** 16; **Move** 15; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 2/30; **Special**: None

### Barracuda

Barracudas are fast, predatory fish. They are smaller than most sharks, and hunt in groups. The great barracuda can reach lengths of 6ft, but barracuda that hunt in schools are from 3-4-ft. in length.

- [Barracuda](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Barracuda): **HD** 1; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d8); **Move** (swim 24); **Save** 17; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 1/15; **Special**: None.

### Basidirond

Basidirons are fungal creatures that resemble inverted umbrellas with stems of dark green or brown hanging beneath it. The inside of its cone-shaped top is inky black. The basidirond stands 7 feet tall, and is believed to be related to the ascomoid (q.v.). It makes it lair in very dry underground caverns. The basidirond attacks by striking with its cone-shaped cap or by releasing a cloud of spores . This cloud of spores measures 20 feet in radius. Creatures within the cloud must succeed on a saving throw or be affected as by a *confusion* spell for as long as they remain in the cloud plus 1d4 rounds after leaving the area. A new save must be made each round a creature remains within the affected area. (For more specific hallucinations see the sidebar text.)

**Basidirond Hallucination Cloud**

Rather than affecting an opponent as by a *confusion* spell, you can randomly determine hallucinations for each creature affected. The duration remains the same as detailed under the creature’s special attack.

**1d8 Hallucination**

**1** Individual believes he is in a swamp and strips off gear and armor to avoid sinking.

**2** Individual believes he is being attacked by a swarm of spiders. He attacks the floor and surrounding area.

**3** Individual believes item held has turned into a viper; drops item and retreats back from it.

**4** Suffocation—Individual believes he is suffocating and gasps for air and clutches throat.

**5** Individual believes he has shrunk to 1/10 normal size. He begins yelling for help.

**6** Individual believes his associates have contracted a disease. He will not come closer than 10 feet.

**7** Individual believes he is melting; grasps self in attempt to hold together.

**8** Individual believes his back is covered with leeches. He tears armor, clothing, etc. from his back to get at them.

A basidirond’s slam attack transfers smothering, poisonous spores to its opponent. A creature struck must succeed on a saving throw or smother in 1d4+1 rounds unless a *cure disease* spell is cast on them. A basidirond takes no damage from a cold effect, but is *slowed* (as the spell). During this time, a basidirond cannot use its poisonous spores or hallucination cloud special attacks.

- Basidirond: **HD** 5; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** Slam (1d8 + spores); **Save** 12; **Move** 9; **AL** N (C tendencies); **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: Hallucination cloud, spores, immune to cold

### Basilisk

Basilisks are great multi-legged lizards whose gaze turns to stone anyone meeting its eye (one way of resolving this: fighting without looking incurs a –4 penalty to hit). If the basilisk’s own gaze is reflected back at it, it has a 10% chance to force the basilisk into a saving throw against being turned to stone itself.

- [Basilisk](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Basilisk): **HD** 6; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 1 bite (2d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 11; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: Petrifaction gaze.

### Basilisk, Desert

Desert basilisks appear to be fat cobra snakes, about 20ft long and 2 ft. in diameter, with four skinny legs that help propel them along the ground and with horns all around the top of the head. These basilisks are extremely poisonous—so much so that even their gaze inflicts 1d6 points of damage unless those meeting its eye make a successful saving throw. Anyone avoiding the basilisk’s gaze attacks with a -4 penalty to hit and damage. In addition, a desert basilisk can spit its poison up to 20ft as a missile attack for 1d12 points of poison damage. The desert basilisk’s bite inflicts 1d4 points of physical damage and the poison inflicts an additional 1d12 points. A saving throw negates the basilisk’s poison, but anyone who purposely comes into physical contact with a basilisk’s hide automatically takes 1d6 points of poison damage. Any weapon that strikes a desert basilisk becomes envenomed and does and additional 1d12 points of poison damage to the next target it hits.

Desert basilisks are solitary monsters, indigenous to desert regions, but are sometimes transported elsewhere by wizards looking for exotic guardians. *(Author: Scottenkainen).*

- [Desert Basilisk](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Basilisk-Desert): **HD** 4+4; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 1 bite or 1 spit (1d4+1d12 or 1d12); **Move** 9; **Save** 13; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 6/400; **Special**: Poisonous gaze (non-lethal).

### Basilisk, Crimson

A crimson basilisk is about 6 feet long and weighs over 400 pounds. Its skin is dull crimson though it can easily change its color to match that of its surroundings. Its eight legs are thick and stout and end in sharpened claws. The spines on its back are crimson as well, though they tend to be darker than its overall body (especially in males). Its eyes glow with a ghostly blue light. A crimson basilisk’s saliva is corrosive, dealing 1d6 points of acid damage with each bite. Any creature within 30 feet that meet’s the creature’s gaze must save or lose 1d4 hit points as their blood weeps from their eyes, ears, nose and mouth. A crimson basilisk that detects fresh blood within 30 feet enters a frenzied state that gives it a +2 to-hit bonus.

- Crimson Basilisk: **HD** 6; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d8 + acid); **Save** 11; **Move** 6; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 7/600; **Special**: Acid bite, blood frenzy, wounding gaze, camouflage

### Basilisk, Greater

Greater basilisks are larger, more vicious cousins of the normal basilisk. They are 12-foot long reptilian monsters with dull brown skin, yellow underbellies and eyes that glow with an eerie, pale green incandescence. Sages believe the greater basilisk hails from the Elemental Plane of Earth.

In combat they rear up on their hind legs and slash opponents with their poisonous claws while also using their deadly gaze attack. The beast’s poisonous claws inflict an additional 1d4 points of damage with each hit unless a successful saving throw is made. The breath of a greater basilisk is so foul that all creatures within 5 feet must succeed on a saving throw or take 1d4 points of damage each round they remain in the area. A creature need only succeed on this saving throw once to avoid further damage from the poisonous breath.

The greater basilisk’s petrifying gaze has a 50-foot range. Those it looks at must succeed at a saving throw or be turned into stone. The greater basilisk is near-sighted and must be within 10 ft. of its reflected gaze to suffer the same fate.

- Greater Basilisk: **HD** 10; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d8 + poison) and bite (1d8); **Save** 5; **Move** 9; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 13/2300; **Special**: Foul breath, petrifying gaze, poison

### Bat Monster

These creatures attack with claws as well as a bite. They are twice the size of a man, with a tremendous wingspan. Fearful peasants might even mistake them for small dragons when they fly by night

- Bat Monster: **HD** 8; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 1 bite (2d8), 2 claws (1d6); **Move** 4 (fly 18); **Save** 8; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 9/1100; **Special**: None.

### Bat, Doombat

The doombat is a giant black bat with glowing yellow eyes. It is a nocturnal hunter that desires living flesh to sustain it. The doombat has a 10-foot wingspan, though specimens with wingspans reaching 25 feet have been reported. The approach of a doombat can be heard long before the creature arrives on the scene, the yipping growing louder as the doombat draws closer. When a doombat yips, all creatures (except other doombats) within a 100-foot spread must succeed on a saving throw or suffer a -1 penalty on attacks rolls and saving throws for the duration of the battle. The yipping is constant, and spellcasters in the area must succeed on a saving throw anytime they attempt to cast a spell. The effect of several doombats yipping at once is not cumulative. Doombats use echolocation to pinpoint creatures within 120 feet, allowing them to attack invisible opponents at no penalty.

- Doombat: **HD** 6; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** Bite (1d8) and tail (1d6); **Save** 11; **Move** 3 (Fly 18); **AL** C; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: Shriek

### Bat, Mobat

Mobats are large, brown bats with razor-sharp fangs and green, glowing eyes. The mobat has a wingspan of approximately 15 feet. It is a nocturnal creature, cruising silently through the night sky in its never ending quest for food. A mobat can blast an ear-splitting screech that affects all within a 20-foot spread. The screech stuns any creature in the area for 1d3 rounds if it fails a saving throw. Mobats use echolocation to pinpoint creatures within 120 feet, allowing them to attack invisible opponents at no penalty.

- Mobat: **HD** 4; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** Bite (1d8); **Save** 13; **Move** 9 (Fly 15); **AL** N (C tendencies); **CL/XP** 6/400; **Special**: Sonic screech

### Bat, Giant (Greater Bat)

Giant bats are massive, man-sized cousins of the bat; they do not suck blood, but their bite is nonetheless deadly. One in ten carries disease.

- Giant Bat: **HD** 4; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d10), 2 claws (1d6); **Move** 4 (fly 18); **Save** 13; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: 10% chance of disease.

### Bat, Giant (Vampire Bat)

These bats suck blood for automatic damage of 1d6 after a successful bite. They are the size of a falcon.

- Giant Bat (Vampire Bat) **HD** 1; **AC** 8 \[11\]; **Atk** bite (2d6); **Move** 4 (Fly 18); **Save** 6; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**: Sucks blood.

### Bears

#### Bear, Black

Black bears are smaller than grizzly bears and polar bears, and have a very broad size range, from 90 pounds (small females) to about 500 pounds (large males). If a black bear hits with both claws, it hugs for an additional 1d8 hit points of damage.

- Black Bear: **HD** 4+1; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d3), 1 bite (1d6); **Move** 9; **Save** 13; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: Hug (1d8).

#### Bear, Grizzly

Very large brown bears, grizzlies hug for an additional 2d6 points of damage (if hitting with both claw attacks) and can automatically maintain the hold, crushing the victim and continuing attempts to bite as well.

- Grizzly Bear: **HD** 6; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d6), 1 bite (1d10); **Move** 9; **Save** 11; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 6/400; **Special**: Hug (2d6).

#### Bear, Cave or Polar

Prehistoric bears and polar bears are even larger than a grizzly bear. When hitting with both claws, they hug for 3d6 points of damage.

- Cave or Polar Bear: **HD** 7; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d6+1), 1 bite (1d10+1); **Move** 12; **Save** 9; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 7/600; **Special**: Hug (3d6).

### Beast of Chaos

A chaos beast resembles a lion with dark, blackened fur, razor-sharp fangs, and oversized paws that wield sharpened claws.

When a beast of chaos growls, roars, hisses, or makes any other sound common to its animal type, all creatures within 30 feet that hear it and those with fewer HD than the beast of chaos must succeed on a saving throw or become shaken for 5d6 rounds.

In the presence of bright light, a beast of chaos flies into a berserk rage, attacking until either it or its opponent is dead. It gains a +1 bonus to hit and damage while enraged. If the source of light is removed, the creature’s rage ends 1d4 rounds later.

Beasts of chaos are immune to *confusion*, *fear*, *hold animal, hold monster*, *slow,* and *haste*.

- Beast of Chaos: **HD** 5; **AC** 0 \[19\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d4) and bite (1d8); **Move** 12; **Save** 15; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: Frightful presence, rage, immunities, magic resistance (25%)

### Bedlam

A bedlam is a semi-amorphous, nearly vaporous creature composed of pure chaos. The creature has no set shape or form. Every minute or so its form changes from that of a smoky gray and vaguely humanoid figure with arms, head, and torso to a swirling mass of grayish-black chaotic matter crackling with bluish-gray energy. A bedlam can unleash a burst of energy against nearby opponents for 4d8 damage (save for half). Spells fizzle around a bedlam, with magic-users needing to make a save to successfully cast a spell.

- Bedlam: **HD** 8; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 2 slams (2d4); **Move** (Fly 30); **Save** 8; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 10/1400; **Special**: Chaos burst, immune to polymorph, spell failure

### Bee, Giant

Giant bees may be found in more than one variety: the giant bee addressed here is the hive-building honeybee. Other varieties include the larger giant bumblebees, which make nests rather than hives. The giant honeybee is essentially the same as normal bees, but they are the size of a football. Giant bees are not killed by stinging an opponent, but the sting only carries enough poison for one injection – if the bee continues to fight rather than fleeing, the sting will only inflict the normal damage caused by the stab itself. The honey produced by giant bees is of superlative quality, and the royal jelly produced to feed larvae has powerful medicinal properties.

- Giant Bee: **HD** 3; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 1 sting (1d3 + poison); **Move** 3 (flying 24); **Save** 14; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Lethal poison sting.

### Beetles (Giant)

#### Beetle, Giant Arcane

A gargantuan beetle with a carapace of mirror-like silver. Arcane Beetles are ideally suited as mounts for warring against magic-users and other arcane spellcasters due to their innate abilities. Any spell cast upon an Arcane Beetle, be it from spells or from magic items, is immediately reflected back at the wizard. *(Author: Skathros).*

- Arcane Beetle: **HD** 5; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** pincers (2d6); **Save** 12; **Move** 12; **CL/XP** 7/600; **Special**: Arcane Reflection.

#### Beetle, Giant Blister

Blister beetles are 3 feet long with slick, dark green carapaces. Their legs are dark green or black and their mandibles are serrated, and black or green in color. When they snap them together, their mandibles produce an audible clicking sound that can be heard up to 10 feet away. When attacked, the beetle releases a foul stream of oily liquid up to 20 feet that irritates an attacker’s skin (1d3 damage, save avoids).

- Giant Blister Beetle: **HD** 2; **AC** 8 \[11\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d6); **Move** 15; **Save** 16; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**: Blister spray, immune to poison

#### Beetle, Giant Boring

Giant boring beetles are 9-foot long, with greenish-gray carapaces and wing-covers and black legs and mandibles. They feed primarily on wood, mold, fungus, and other organic matter and make their lairs inside ancient tunnels and caverns, where they harvest and grow molds and fungi. Shriekers are prized for both food and their use as alarms to warn the boring beetles of intrusion. Boring beetles are about 9 feet long. All boring beetles within 1 mile of each other are in constant communication. If one is aware of a particular danger, they all are. If one in the group is not surprised then none of them are.

- Giant Boring Beetle: **HD** 5; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** Bite (2d8); **Move** 9; **Save** 12; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Hive mind

#### Beetle, Giant Deathwatch

This creature appears as a giant beetle with a dark green carapace and wing-covers. Its body is covered in leaves and sticks. Its mandibles are silver and its legs are black. The death watch beetle makes its lair in forests and uses a mixture of saliva and earth to stick rubbish (leaves and twigs, for instance) to itself in order to attack by surprise. Once every hour, a death watch beetle can vibrate its carapace to produce a clicking noise that sets up vibrations in all creatures within 30 feet. Affected creatures with 6 HD or less must succeed on a saving throw or die immediately. Creatures with more than 6 HD or those that succeed on their saving throw take 4d6 points of damage. Since the effect stems from the vibrations set up in a victim’s body and not from the clicking noise itself, *silence* offers no protection against this attack. Likewise, a creature that cannot hear can still be affected.

- Giant Deathwatch Beetle: **HD** 9; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** Bite (1d8); **Move** 12; **Save** 6; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 11/1700; **Special**: Death rattle, immune to death spells, surprise on a 1-4 on 1d6

#### Beetle, Giant Fire

A giant fire beetle’s oily light-glands glow reddishly, and continue to give off light for 1d6 days after they are removed (shedding light in a 10 ft. radius).

- Giant Fire Beetle: **HD** 1+3; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d4+2); **Move** 12; **Save** 17; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 1/15; **Special**: Light glands.

#### Beetle, Giant Huhu

This large winged beetle has a brown and yellow-striped carapace, horny black antennae and powerful jaws. Its barbed legs hook relentlessly into the victim’s hair, fur or clothing. It is attracted to light sources. The pale yellow HuHu grubs are extremely nutritious and taste like peanut butter. *(Author: Mudguard).*

- Giant HuHu Beetle: **HD** 1+3;AC 4 \[15\]; **Atk** Bite (2d6); **Move** 9 (18 fly); **Save** 17; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 2/30; **Special**: Grab hold.

#### Beetle, Giant Rhinoceros

Giant rhinoceros beetles are 12-foot long beetles with grayish-brown carapaces and wing-covers and a large brownish-black “horns” between its mandibles. They are found in the warm jungles and forests of the world and spend their days searching for plants, fruits, and berries on which to sustain themselves. Giant rhinoceros beetles can trample smaller creatures by simply moving over them, inflicting 3d6 points of damage (save for half damage).

- Giant Rhinoceros Beetle: **HD** 12; **AC** 1 \[18\]; **Atk** Bite (2d8) and gore (2d6); **Move** 9; **Save** 3; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 12/2000; **Special**: Trample (3d6)

#### Beetle, Giant Saw-Toothed

A giant saw-toothed beetle has oversized serrated mandibles to chew and crush its food. These creatures are about 6 feet long. Their wing covers and carapace are silvery-green in color and have a dull sheen. Their legs are long with spiraling bands of green and black. Its compound eyes aid it in detecting creatures moving close by, though it usually relies on motion and scent to pick up its prey. If a serrated beetle hits with a bite, it holds the prey in is massive mandibles, automatically inflicting 1d6 damage in the next round until the creature is freed.

- Giant Saw-Toothed Beetle: **HD** 4; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 1 bite (2d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 13; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Grab

#### Beetle, Giant Slicer

This creature appears as a giant beetle with a triangular head and two long, razor sharp mandibles. Its body is black in color. It closely resembles a large stag beetle and is often mistaken for such. However, the slicer beetle is more aggressive than the stag beetle. The creature dines on carrion, fresh meat, and leaves. Slicer beetles are about 10 feet long, but can grow to lengths of 20 feet or more. If a slicer beetle scores a natural 20 on its attack roll and its victim fails a saving throw, it severs one of the opponent’s extremities (roll 1d6: 1-3 arm, 4-6 leg; 50% chance of either right or left).

- Giant Slicer Beetle: **HD** 6; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** Bite (3d8); **Move** 9; **Save** 11; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: Vorpal bite

#### Beetle, Giant Water

The highly aggressive giant water beetles average about 6 feet long though they can grow to a length of about 10 feet. Their body is cylindrical and hydrodynamic, tapering into a pointed tail section. Their body shape allows them to move rapidly through the water and also aids them in hunting, allowing them to dive quickly through the water when a target is spotted. Typical coloration is black or dark brown with their wing covers following their body coloration. Some species of giant water beetle have yellow legs or a silver stripe on their dorsal side. Females are slightly larger than males and have a red band around their front legs. They rarely come on land, and never venture far from a water source. Once per minute, a water beetle can eject a foul-smelling liquid from its abdomen that sickens creatures nearby.

- Giant Water Beetle: **HD** 3; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d8); **Move** 6 (Swim 24); **Save** 14; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**: Stench spray, aquatic

### Beetle, Requiem

The gigantic requiem beetle has a dark red carapace, blackish-red wing covers, and black legs. Two large claw-like pincers protrude from its front to slash and rip the air around the creature. Its oversized mandibles are dark reddish-black. Requiem beetles measure about 40 feet long and weigh about 18 tons. A requiem beetle that hits a single opponent with both claws automatically constricts for 5d6 points of damage. Whenever a requiem beetle moves more than 10 feet in a round, all creatures within 10 feet must save or fall down as the earth shakes.

- Requiem Beetle: **HD** 18; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 2 claws (3d6+4) and bite (2d8+4); **Move** 18; **Save** 3; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 20/4400; **Special**: Constrict, earth-shaking

### Behir

The behir is a serpentine monster that can slither like a snake or use its dozen legs to move with considerable speed. A behir is about 40 feet long. Most are a deep blue color. Behirs attack by biting, and will swallow prey whole on a natural roll of 20. They also lash their bodies around prey (to hit), and on the first round following this attack they can bring 6 claws into play (6 attacks, 1d6 hit points per attack).

Behirs also have a breath weapon – they can spit a bolt of lightning once per 10 rounds, inflicting 24 points of damage (2 per hit die, for smaller or larger behirs). A successful saving throw indicates half damage.

- [Behir](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Behir): **HD** 12; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d8); **Move** 15; **Save** 3; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 13/2300; **Special**: Constrict and claw, lightning breath.

### Belabra (Tangler)

Belabras resemble a man-sized flying jellyfish with a hard, chitinous shell and twelve long tentacles. Four thin, pupil-less eyestalks protrude from its cap. A small, bird-like beak is hidden among its array of tentacles. Its cap is blackish-gray and its eyestalks are dark gray. They dwell in deep forests and thick undergrowth and sustain themselves on a diet of plants, berries, and rodents. Particularly hungry belabras will attack larger creatures, such as humanoids. Each time a belabra is hit with a slashing or piercing weapon, all creatures within a 10-foot radius must succeed on a saving throw or be sprayed by the creature’s acidic blood. A creature that fails its save is partially blinded and overcome with fits of sneezing. Both effects last 1d6+2 rounds. An affected creature takes a –4 penalty to hit, –1 penalty to AC, loses its Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) and moves at half speed. All checks relying on vision have a 50% chance of failing. A belabra’s tentacles are lined with razor-sharp barbs. Anytime a grappled creature attempts to break free and fails, it takes 1d4 points of piercing damage from the barbs.

- Belabra: **HD** 4; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** Slam (2d6) or 12 tentacles (1d2) and bite (1d6); **Move** 3 (Fly 9); **Save** 13; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 6/400; **Special**: Acidic blood, tentacle barbs

### Bhuta

When a person is murdered, the spirit sometimes clings to the Material Plane, refusing to accept its mortal death. This spirit, called a bhuta, possesses its original body and seeks out those responsible for its murder. It will never rest until those responsible are sought out and slain. Since the transformation into unlife is almost instant (occurring within 1-2 hours after death), the bhuta appears as it did in life for about 2 weeks, taking on a more decayed appearance thereafter. Close inspection (spot on a roll of 1-2 on 1d6) reveals slight decay, and the body still shows signs of any trauma suffered prior to death (wounds, disease, burns, or the like), but outwardly, the bhuta for the most part appears as a normal creature of its race. In its undead state, the bhuta sustains itself on a diet of flesh, preferring that of humans and elves. A bhuta that scores two successful claw attacks on an opponent in the same round fastens its hands around its opponent’s throat and deals 1d6+1 damage per round until the hold is broken with a successful attack by the victim. The bhuta’s main objective is revenge on the person that killed it. So long as the bhuta and its killer are on the same plane of existence, it can find its target unerringly.

- Belabra: **HD** 7; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 9; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: Death grip

### Biclops

A biclops appears to be a filthy ettin, but has one eye in the center of each ugly head. They are feared by less intelligent monsters such as hill giants and trolls, whom they beat to death on sight. They throw two rocks for 3d6 points of damage.

- Belabra: **HD** 12+2; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 2 weapons (4d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 3; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 13/2300; **Special**: Hurl boulders

### Birhaakamen (Wild Bird-men)

Birhaakamen are bird-men, entirely feathered, with beaks and clawed hands at their wing-joints. They live in tribal aeries and are generally not civilized. They carry javelins, and some of the more civilized aeries arm their warriors with spears and shields. These more advanced bird-men may wear scraps of armor, increasing their **AC** to 4 \[15\].

- Birhaakaman: **HD** 1+3; **AC** 6 \[13\] or 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d2) and beak (1d3) or by weapon (1d8); **Move** 12 (Fly 18); **Save** 17; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 2/30; **Special**: None.

### Black Pudding

Black puddings are amorphous globs with an acidic surface. They are subterranean predators and scavengers. Any weapon or armor contacting a black pudding will be eaten away by the acid as follows: weapon (1 hit by the weapon), chainmail or lesser armor (1 hit by pudding), plate mail (2 hits by pudding). If a weapon or armor is magical, it can take an additional hit per +1 before being dissolved.

- [Black Pudding](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Black-Pudding): **HD** 10; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 1 attack (3d8); **Move** 6; **Save** 5; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 12/2000; **Special**: Acidic surface, immune to cold, divides when hit with lightning.

### Bleeding Horror

Created by the *axe of blood,* these foul undead creatures drip with the blood they were so willing to sacrifice to the hungry blade. They are filled with the unquenchable desire for blood to feed the weapon that created them. Bleeding horrors appear as skeletons or sunken corpses covered in and continuously dripping thick red blood. Their eyes glow with a desire for blood. They may wear armor and wield weapons.

A living creature within 60 feet that views a bleeding horror must succeed on a saving throw or take 1d6 points of strength damage. This damage cannot reduce a victim’s strength below 0, but anyone reduced to strength 0 is helpless.

When a bleeding horror successfully hits a living opponent with a claw attack, it heals a number of hit points equal to the damage dealt. However, it can’t gain more than the subject’s current hit points, which is enough to kill the subject. A bleeding horror can’t gain more hit points than the maximum hit points allowed by its Hit Dice.

If a bleeding horror hits an opponent with both claw attacks in a single round, that opponent suffers catastrophic blood expulsion, taking 1d4 points of constitution damage. A successful saving throw reduces the damage by half. For each point of constitution damage dealt, a bleeding horror gains 4 temporary hit points. Any creature slain by the blood consumption attack of a bleeding horror becomes a bleeding horror in 1d4 minutes under the command of its creator.

If the *axe of blood* is taken from a bleeding horror before the creature is destroyed, it can find it unerringly*.*

**Minor Artifact: The Axe of Blood**

The *axe of blood* is rather nondescript, being made of dull iron. Only the large, strange rune carved into the side of its double-bladed head gives any immediate indication that the axe may be more than it seems. The rune is one of lesser life stealing, carved on it long ago by a sect of evil sorcerers. This is, in fact, the only remaining copy of that particular rune, thus making the axe a valuable item. Further inspection reveals another strange characteristic: the entire length of the axe’s long haft of darkwood is wrapped in a thick leather thong stained black from years of being soaked in blood and sticky to the touch. When held, the axe feels strangely heavy but well balanced, and it possesses a keenly sharp blade.

Until activated, the axe is just a *+1 battleaxe*. The wielder must consult *legend lore* or some other similar source of information to learn the ritual required to feed the axe. Despite the gruesome ritual required to power the axe, the weapon is not chaotic but is instead neutral. Bound inside it is a rather savage earth spirit.

The axe draws power from its wielder in order to become a mighty magic weapon. Each day, the wielder of the axe can choose to “feed” the axe, sacrificing some of his blood in a strange ritual. This ritual takes 30 minutes and must be done at dawn.

Using the axe, the wielder opens a wound on his person (dealing 1d6 points of damage) and feeds the axe with his own blood. The wielder sacrifices blood in the form of hit points. For each 1d6 hit points sacrificed, the wielder gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls with the axe (to a maximum of +3). Hit points sacrificed to the axe cannot be healed magically, but heal at the rate of 1 point per day. Similarly, the damage caused by the opening of the wound may not be healed by any means until the sacrificed hit points are regained.

There is a chance that the hit points sacrificed to the axe is lost permanently. If the wielder always skips a day in between powering the axe and always powers the axe with the morning ritual, there is no chance of permanent loss. If, however, the axe is fed on consecutive days, there is a 1% chance plus a 1% cumulative chance per consecutive day the axe is powered that hit points sacrificed to the axe on that day is permanently lost.

If reduced to 0 hit points as a result of feeding the axe, the wielder becomes a bleeding horror.

- Bleeding Horror: **HD** 6; **AC** -1 \[20\]; **Atk** *Axe of Blood* (2d6) or 2 claws (1d8); **Move** 12; **Save** 11; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 10/1400; **Special**: Blood consumption, horrific appearance, +1 or better weapon to hit, magic resistance (10%)

### Blindeim

Blindheims are 4-foot tall frog-like humanoids with large, bulbous eyes that constantly emit bright yellow beams of light. A blindheim’s skin is mottled yellow, growing darker across its back. Its feet are webbed as are its claws. Blindheims dwell in underground caverns and sustain themselves on a diet of fungi, molds, and small rodents. An extra eyelid allows the blindheim to “turn off” its eyes when it is sleeping or resting. A dead blindheim’s eyes are dull gold in color. A blindheim can turn its eyes on and off as it wishes, but always leaves them on during combat. When open, the eyes emit a 30-foot cone of light. It can see normally in this light and functions normally in areas of magical darkness. A creature looking at a blindheim when its eye beams are “on” must succeed on a saving throw or be blinded for 1 hour.

- Blindheim: **HD** 4; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** Bite (1d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 13; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Eye beams

### Blink Dog

Blink dogs are pack hunters, intelligent and usually friendly to those who are not of evil intent. They can teleport short distances (without error) and attack in the same turn – in most cases (75%) a blink dog will be able to teleport behind an opponent and attack from the rear (with appropriate bonuses).

- [Blink Dog](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Blink-Dog): **HD** 4; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 11; **AL** L; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: Teleport.

### Blood Bush

A blood bush is a 3-foot-tall flowering bush with a thick trunk and small whip-like branches. Each branch is topped with a blood-red flower and deep, rich green leaves. A victim hit by a dart must make a saving throw or be paralyzed for 1d6+1 rounds.

- Blood Bush: **HD** 4; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 4 tendrils (1d4), 6 flower darts (1d2); **Move** 0; **Save** 13; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: Paralysis

### Blood Hawk

The blood hawk is nearly identical to a normal hawk and is often mistaken for one, but it is stronger and far more aggressive than a normal hawk and has red talons and a dull red beak. Blood hawks love the taste of human flesh and are relentless in their hunt of human prey. They often steal gems from the corpses of their humanoid prey, which they use to line their nests.

- Blood Hawk: **HD** 1; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d4) and bite (1d6); **Move** 6 (Flying 36); **Save** 17; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 2/30; **Special**: None

### Bloodsuckle

A bloodsuckle is a nightmarish bush consisting of a bulbous root from which sprout several vine-like tendrils. The tendrils end in hollow, needle-like points and can reach lengths of 60 feet. Woody limbs as thick as a human’s leg sprout from the trunk of the bloodsuckle. The leaves of a bloodsuckle bush are a vile greenish color, and constantly ooze a sticky sap that reeks of decay, filth, and other unmentionable odors. Bloodsuckles are semi-intelligent. immobile plants that gain nourishment from the blood of living creatures. A bloodsuckle injects its sap into a host using its tendrils so it can control the creature to attack others or approach the plant to drain its blood. If a bloodsuckle hits a victim with both tendrils, it automatically begins draining the creature’s blood (1d4 hit points per round). Once per month, a bloodsuckle can generate a walnut-sized seed that it implant’s in a host’s body. The host is then sent away, and a new bloodsuckle sprouts in the victim in 1d4 days. If threatened, the bloodsuckle can produce a high-pitched whine that draws nearby hosts to defend it.

- Bloodsuckle: **HD** 6; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 2 tendrils (1d4), limb rake (1d6); **Move** 0; **Save** 11; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: Blood drain, create host, grab, summon host, seed

### Bloody Bones

Bloody bones are evil undead spirits that haunts caverns, caves, and other desolate places. Their true origins are unknown, but they are believed to be the undead remains of those who desecrate evil temples and are punished by the gods for their wrongdoings. It appears as a skeletal humanoid with bits of muscle and sinew hanging from its body. Four long, sinewy tendrils writhe from its midsection. The entire creature constantly oozes a mixture of blood and mucus. Its eye sockets are hollow and show no pupils. A creature hit by the monster’s tendril attack must pass a saving throw or be held fast and dragged toward the bloody bones. The bloody bones’ tendrils have 10 hit points each and an AC of 3 \[16\]. Bloody bones are difficult to wrestle or snare due to the constant flow of blood and mucus across their bodies. Webs, magic or otherwise, do not affect bloody bones, and they usually wiggle free from most other forms of confinement.

- Bloody Bones: **HD** 5; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 4 tendrils (see below) and 2 claws (1d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 12; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 7/600; **Special**: Tendrils, slippery, resistance to fire (50%)

### Boalisk

A boalisk is a constrictor snake 12 to 30 feet long with dark scales interspersed with pale green and yellow daubs of color to help it blend in with its surroundings on the forest floor. The eyes of a boalisk are large and reddish in color. They dwell in misty jungles and along dark riverbanks. Boalisks have a powerful bite attack. Victims of a successful bite attack must succeed at a saving throw or be ensnared by the serpent’s coils and constricted for 1d8 points of damage per round. The boalisk’s more potent ability is its terrible gaze. Those within 30 feet that meet the boalisk’s gaze must succeed on a saving throw or contract black rot. Black rot strikes at a victim almost immediately, causing the skin to become black and glossy and terrible swelling in the joints and face. Each day, a victim of the rot loses 1d6 points of constitution and charisma if they fail a saving throw. The disease persists until the victim succeeds at two consecutive daily saving throws. A victim of the disease dies when their constitution reaches 0. A recovering victim regains 1 point of charisma and 1 point of constitution per day of rest.

- Boalisk: **HD** 5; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** Bite (1d8); **Move** 9 (Climb 9/Swim 9); **Save** 12; **AL** N; **CL/XP**6/400; **Special**: Constrict, gaze

### Boar, Giant

### Boar, Wild

Boars continue to attack for two rounds after they are actually killed before they drop dead. These stats might also be used for your “blue tusken-hogs of the Ymar Plains,” or whatever is appropriate for your campaign. Sows have the same hit dice, but do not have tusks. They bite viciously, however, inflicting 1d6 points of damage.

- Wild Boar: **HD** 3+3; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 1 gore (3d4); **Move** 15; **Save** 14; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: continue attacks 2 rounds after death.

### Bog Beast

Bog beasts make their homes in bogs and swamps and feed on creatures that dwell there. They are avid hunters and a bog beast’s hunting area usually covers a large expanse of ground several miles around its lair. It makes its lair amid overgrown swamplands and attacks just about any creature that travels too close to its lair. They are large humanoids with shaggy fur and clawed hands and feet. Two, long, upright tusks protrude from its mouth. Its eyes are dull brown and its fur is brownish-yellow. A bog beast stands over 9 feet tall and weighs around 1,100 pounds. They seem to be able to communicate with one another through a series of guttural grunts and growls, but do not speak any known language. If a bog beast succeeds on both claw attacks against an opponent, they rend for an additional 2d6 damage. Characters who suffer damage from a bog beast’s claws must pass a saving throw or come down with a case of swamp fever. The fever causes swelling of the joints and fills the lungs with fluid. The diseased character’s movement rate is cut in half and they suffer a -2 penalty to AC and saving throws. Each day, they receive a saving throw at a -2 penalty to shake off the disease.

- Bog Beast: **HD** 5; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d6 + swamp fever); **Move** 12; **Save** 12; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 6/400; **Special**: Swamp fever, rend with claws

### Bog Creeper

The bog creeper is a creature native to the thickest, darkest swamps. It superficially resembles a man-sized rotted tree trunk sprouting several thorny tendrils each about 10 feet long and a single 6-foot long limb. Bog creepers are carnivorous, lurking amid dead trees and stumps waiting to ambush unsuspecting prey. When prey comes within range, a bog creeper lashes out with its single limb and slashes with its tendrils. If two tendrils hit the same opponent, the creature grabs the victim and constricts it for 2d4 damage as it transfers the prey to its mouth. Three times per day, a bog creeper can vomit digestive sap on opponents (2d8 points of damage; save for half).

- Bog Creeper: **HD** 7; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 1 slam (1d6), 4 tendrils (1d4) or bite (2d4); **Move** 4 (Swim 9); **Save** 9; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: Constrict, spit acid, camouflage

### Bog Mummy

Bog mummies resemble normal mummies, but are covered with a thin layer of swamp mud. Bog mummies rarely leave the swamp where they were formed. They hate life and attack any living creature that trespasses in their swamp. Bog mummies can only be harmed by magic weapons. Its touch infects victims who fail a saving throw with bog rot, a supernatural disease that does not allow wounds to heal naturally, and cuts magical healing in half until cured with the *cure disease* spell. Humanoids killed by a bog mummy rise as bog mummies themselves in 1d4 days unless their bodies are removed from the swamp or a *cure disease* spell is cast on the corpse. A bog mummy’s movement is unaffected by mud, marshes and swamps.

- Bog Mummy: **HD** 8; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** Slam (1d6 + bog rot); **Move** 9; **Save** 8; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 10/1400; **Special**: Bog rot, +1 or better weapon to hit, resistance to fire (50%)

### Bogeyman

A bogeyman is a man-sized undead that lacks a corporeal body. A bogeyman can create realistic illusions and sounds to scare victims, and can only be hit by magical weapons. An opponent seeing a bogeyman must make a saving throw or run in fear (as per the spell).

- Bogeyman: **HD** 6; **AC** 5 \[12\]; **Atk** claw (1d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 11; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 7/600; **Special**: Frighten, create illusions, magical weapons to hit

### Boggart

Although a boggart’s natural form is that of a small will-o’-wisp, boggarts usually take the form of a 2-foot tall humanoid with unkempt dark hair, an untrimmed shaggy beard, thick mustache, pale skin and green eyes. The boggart is a relative of the will-o-wisp. Sages believe it to be a sort of “larval” or immature form of said creature. Boggarts are immune to most spells or spell-like abilities that allow spell resistance, except *magic missile, protection from evil, protection from evil 10-ft. radius* and *maze*. Boggarts can use *ESP* (as the spell) at will and can become *invisible* for 10 minutes each day. Once per day, a boggart can unleash a screech that causes *confusion* (per the spell) in all those within 30 feet who fail a saving throw. The confusion lasts for 6 rounds. Each additional boggart within 10 feet that joins the screeching imposes a -1 penalty to the saving throw. Boggarts not only deliver electrical shocks with their physical attacks, but also throw electrical current up to 10 feet, dealing 2d6 points of damage (save for half).

- Boggart: **HD** 6; **AC** -1 \[20\]; **Atk** Electrical discharge (2d6); **Move** 9; **Save** 11; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: Immune to magic, magical abilities

### Bone Cobbler

The bone cobbler is a tattered and desiccated humanoid often mistaken for a zombie in weak light. The bone cobbler is a malign and evil creature that delights in slaying its opponents and stripping the flesh from their bones. Bone cobblers take the skeletal remains of those they kill and combine them with other bones in their lair. From these bones they sculpt and form weird humanoid or half-humanoid skeletal statues. Once per day, a bone cobbler can animate up to 5 skeletal statues within 30 feet. These creatures fight as skeletons, though their forms and structures do not necessarily resemble anything remotely humanoid. A bone cobbler can rapidly strip all the flesh from a human-sized creature in 3 rounds using its claws and hammers. Once stripped, the bone cobbler devours the flesh and collects the victim’s bones to use in its “sculptures”. A creature slain in this manner can only be brought back to life by a *wish* spell. Finally, a bone cobbler can bellow forth a cloud of vapors every 1d4+1 rounds that covers a 10-foot-radius area. Creatures within the area must succeed on a saving throw or be slowed (as the *slow* spell) for 1d4 rounds.

- Bone Cobbler: **HD 5**; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 2 hammers (1d4) or 2 claws (1d3); **Move** 12; **Save** 12; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 7/600; **Special**: Animate bones, breath weapon

### Bone Mound

When a nugget of pure chaos ends up in the material plane, the result can be a bone mound, a jelly-like creature that exudes a sticky film from its pores. At first glance, a bone mound appears to be a massive heap of bones and broken skeletal remains, for it picks up osseous material that sticks to the slime-beast’s blob-like form, giving it the appearance of a pile of bones. This bone-collecting slime possesses a secondary ability that makes it a truly dangerous foe. In addition to the adhesive film it exudes, the piece of pure chaos at the bone mound’s core gives it an innate ability to animate, partially, the bones that stick to it. The effects of this spell-like ability extend up to 2ft away from the creature’s body. The bone mound can animate 1d6 of the bony remains that have adhered to it each round. Each of these animated body parts may attack once, inflicting 1d4 damage. A cleric may turn these newly living bits of skeletal remains as if they were Type 1 undead. The bone mound may shift its animate dead power from one set of bones to another at any time.

The chaos nugget inside the mound, which looks like a bit of charcoal, is quite dangerous - it dissolves instantly into anyone who touches it, and the victim must make a saving throw at -2 or the nugget will re-form inside his body and he will become a bone mound himself in 1d6 days. *(Author: Skathros)*.

- [Bone Mound](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Bone-Mound): **HD** 10; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 1d6 claw/kick/bite (1d4 each); **Move** 6; **Save** 5; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 12/2000; **Special**: Animate Dead, Multiple Attacks.

### Boneneedle

Boneneedles are bloated, yellowish-white blobs of rubbery flesh with spidery legs of black or gold. Two long, sharply-curved mandibles protrude from the monster. The mandibles are glossy-black and hollow, and aid the boneneedle in piercing its prey’s flesh and bone and siphoning off its meal. After feeding, its form takes on a sickly yellow color. The boneneedle’s bite secretes a thick, syrupy neurotoxin that breaks down bone (save resists). A creature with weakened bones suffers an extra +2 damage each time he is struck.

- Boneneedle: **HD** 2 **AC** 8 \[11\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d3 + marrow poisoning); **Move** 18; **Save** 16; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**: Marrow poisoning, aversion to daylight

### Bonesnapper

The bonesnapper resembles a man-sized bipedal dinosaur with gray-green flesh mottled with gray spots. Its eyes are scarlet and its teeth are yellow. Though unintelligent, it is fond of collecting and decorating its lair with the jawbones of its victims.

- Bonesnapper: **HD** 4 **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** Bite (1d8) and tail slap (1d3); **Move** 9; **Save** 13; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: Surprise on a roll of 1-2 on 1d6

### Bonesucker

This bizarre creature resembles a fleshy tree trunk. Atop its main body protrudes a mass of writhing tentacles that constantly ooze and drip a brownish-yellow fluid. These tentacles appear to be only one or two feet long, but can be extended up to 10 feet. Near the top of its body is a ring of black, unblinking eyes that make it impossible for the monster to be surprised. Bonesuckers stand about 10 feet tall and move about through the use of 5 thick tentacles at their base. They stalk the darkness of wastelands and dank caves. Bonesuckers consume only the bones of an opponent by grabbing it and piercing its flesh with its hollow tentacles. Victims of a successful tentacle attack must pass a saving throw or be held fast and pierced by the hollow, bony protrusions that line the tentacle. These tubes inject digestive enzymes into the bones, inflicting 2d4 points of damage and causing 1d2 points of strength damage each round.

- Bonesucker: **HD** 8 **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 4 tentacles (1d4+4 + liquefy bones); **Move** 9; **Save** 8; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 10/1400; **Special**: Liquefy bones, +1 or better weapon to hit

### Bookworm

The bookworm is a tiny, 1-inch long, gray, seemingly normal worm. This miniscule creature is the bane of scholars, wizards, and sages, for its primary source of food is the paper, wood, and leather that make up books.

Bookworms cannot harm living creatures, but they burrow through wood, leather, rope, and paper very quickly. They ignore the hardness of such materials, and a burrowing bookworm deals 3 points of damage per round to dead wood, rope, paper, or leather. Bookworms are quick and agile (move 9) and seek to avoid being seen. To this end, they can alter their body color to match that of their surroundings. They surprise on a roll of 1-4 on 1d6.

Scrolls are destroyed in a single round and any spells contained on it are destroyed as well. A spellbook loses one spell level per round that a bookworm spends burrowing into it. For example, a spellbook has 100 pages and can hold a maximum of 100 total spell levels (a spell takes up one page per spell level). Multiple bookworms can destroy a spellbook much faster. Each bookworm burrowing through a book destroys one spell level per round.

A typical lair (or brood) contains 1d4 x 10 bookworms. They are easily killed by attacks that deal damage over an area (such as fire or cold). Consider one worm killed for each point of damage dealt.

### Borsin (Ape Centaur)

A borsin is a creature with the head, arms, and upper body of an ape joined to the body and legs of a quadruped. The lower half may be that of a boar, equine, or hound; these may be a race of battle-beasts magically crossbred in antiquity. A borsin has a savage cunning, and is capable of problem-solving and setting crude traps. They do not use weapons or tools, or carry treasure, although pack leaders will drape themselves in the skins and furs of creatures they have killed – including humans and adventurers.

Borsin form packs led by the strongest member. They attack with two claws and a bite, and use pack tactics to drive opponents and prey into traps, kill zones, or natural hazards such as cliffs and ravines. If both its claws hit the same opponent, a borsin can hug and rend for an additional 2d6 points of damage. Borsin packs stake out their territory by making small cairns topped with the skulls of their kills, and patrol their borders regularly. Borsin are omnivorous and hardy, capable of surviving on plant matter, yet enjoying a fresh kill. *(Author: Scott Wylie Roberts, "Myrystyr").*

- Borsin: **HD** 4; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d4) and 1 bite (1d3); **Move** 15; **Save** 13; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: Hug and rend.

### Brainosaurian

Brainosaurians are highly intelligent dinosaurs, possibly the remnant survivors of some ancient saurian civilization. They are the size of an allosaurus, standing approximately ten feet at the shoulder. A brainosaurian is able to communicate with and control most types of dinosaurs, although this control is not perfect: herbivorous dinosaurs will still instinctively keep their distance from carnivores, for example. Brainosaurians are generally found in areas where dinosaurs are common.

Some rare brainosaurians are shamans, able to cast spells as a 4th to 8th level cleric. *(Author: Matt Finch).*

- Brainosaurian: **HD** 10; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 2 claws or weapons (1d6) and 1 bite (3d6); **Move** 15; **Save** 5; **AL** Any; **CL/XP** 11/1700; **Special**: Control Saurian.

### Brainstorm

Brainstorms are creatures that reside in the ethereal plane of existence; they are incorporeal, able to move through solid objects and only vulnerable to magic weapons (and spells). The central body of a brainstorm resembles an almost transparent sphere with a ghostly-looking brain at the center. A brainstorm attacks by sending out waves of mental power in a cone shape, extending 100ft from the creature with a 10ft width at the origin and 100ft wide at the end of the cone. Anything caught within the cone must make a saving throw or be affected by one of the following:

**1.** Charmed (1d6 rounds)
**2.** Fear (flee for 1d6 turns)
**3.** Paralysis (1d6 turns)
**4.** Unbearable headache (2d6 points of damage, lasts only 1 round)
**5.** Levitated 10ft from ground
**6.** Rage (attack allies for 1d6 rounds)
**7.** Healed by 1d6 hit points
**8.** Teleported (safely) 1d20 x10ft from present location in random direction
**9.** Drop all items held
**10.** Headache (1d6 hit points damage)

Characters that are already under the effects of the brainstorm and are hit a second time by the storm will automatically take 1d2 points of headache damage rather than rolling a second result. If anyone is killed by one of the “headache” results, the character’s head explodes, a problem that must be addressed before raising the character from the dead. *(Author: Matt Finch).*

- Brainstorm: **HD** 5; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** Special; **Move** (9 flying); **Save** 12; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 7/600; **Special**: Brainstorm.

### Brass Man

A brass man is an 8-foot tall humanoid composed of brass and weighing about 900 pounds. Its facial features are exquisitely and delicately worked. Some brass men have ancient runes and symbols carved into their bodies. Many are constructed with weapons, though the average brass golem relies on its fists. In combat, a brass man can spit a 30-foot stream of molten brass every 1d4 rounds (6d6 damage). Lightning slows a brass man, and fire heals it. They are immune to all other spells.

- Brass Man: **HD** 10 **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 1 slam or 1 weapon (3d6); **Move** 6; **Save** 5; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 12/2000; **Special**: Spit molten brass (6d6), +1 or better magic weapon to hit, slowed by lightning, healed by fire, immune to spells

### Brownie

A brownie is a timid, quiet fey creature that prefers to live only among its own kind. Most brownies dwell in pastoral areas untouched by civilization, such as deep forests and wild lands far from other creatures. They resemble 18-inch tall elves with greenish skin and brown, gray or tawny hair. Most brownies prefer green or otherwise brightly colored clothing. They may be distant relatives of pixies and halflings, but this has never been proven. In woodland areas, brownies surprise on a roll of 1-4 on 1d6, and is only surprised on a roll of 1 on 1d8. The can use the following spells once per day each: *Confusion*, *continual light*, *dimension door*, *protection from evil 10-ft. radius* and *mirror image*.

- Brownie: **HD** 1d3 **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** Tiny sword (1d3); **Move** 9; **Save** 18; **AL** L; **CL/XP** 1/15; **Special**: Magic resistance (25%), spells

### Brume

A brume is an opaque spirit that takes human form. It can only be hit by magical weapons. A brume’s claws cause an opponent to forget everything that has happened in the last 1d6 hours (save resists). A brume can create a billowing fog to appear three times a day.

- Brume: **HD 7** **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d6); **Move** 15; **Save** 9; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: Magical weapons to hit, magical abilities

### Brykolakas

Brykolakas are 6-foot-tall humanoid creatures with bluish-gray skin and unkempt black or gray hair. They can assume the shape of a dolphin or a manta ray at will. Their eyes burn with a hatred for living creatures, and their hands end in razor-sharp talons with black or broken nails. Brykolakas dress in flowing robes or gowns. When killed, a brykolakas’ body changes into a pool of deadly poison (2d4 points of damage to all within 10 feet). The creature’s claws also carry a deadly infection that deteriorates a victim’s organs (save or die). Any humanoid slain by a byrkolakas rises as a kalanos in 1d4 days under the creature’s control.

- Brykolakas: **HD** 5; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d6 + infection); **Move** 6 (Swim 24); **Save** 12; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 4/600; **Special**: Create spawn, death throes, infection, change shape
- Kalanos: **HD** 3; **AC** 8\[11\]; **Attack** 1 slam (1d4 + 1 level drain); **Save** 14; **AL** C; **Move** 6 (Swim 24); **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: Level drain (1)

### Buckawn

Buckawns look like halfling-sized humanoids with swarthy skin, dark hair, greenish-brown eyes and brown clothes. Buckawns are somehow related to brownies, but they are nowhere near as kind-hearted and playful. Buckawns are extremely reclusive and rarely have dealings with outside races. Trade of any kind between a buckawn tribe and another race is virtually unheard of. Characters who journey into a buckawn’s realm are usually left alone, providing they themselves leave the buckawn’s realm alone. Buckawns readily use poisoned blades when confronted with a tough opponent, when outnumbered, or when battling opponents for whom they have great disdain. They favor moonseed berries as poison and usually have a plentiful supply readily available (see the sidebar).

Buckawns can use the following spells at will: *Phantasmal force*, *invisibility* and *insect plague* (1/day).

**Moonseed Berries**

These small berries are bluish-purple and resemble wild grapes. They are highly poisonous and are often mixed with food or crushed and smeared on a weapon or object. The poison is deadly unless the victim succeeds at a saving throw. Even if the saving throw is successful, the poison inflicts 1d8 points of damage. A vial of the poison can be purchased from unsavory types for 1,500 gp.

- Buckawn: **HD** 1d6; **AC** 2\[17\]; **Attack** Dagger (1d3) or dart (1d3); **Save** 12; **AL** N; **Move** 6 (Swim 24); **CL/XP** 2/30; **Special**: Poison use, spells, magic resistance (10%)

### Bugbear

These large, hairy, goblin-like humanoids are stealthier than their size would suggest, getting the chance to surprise even alert opponents with a roll of 1-3 on a d6 (50%). Bugbears stand from 7-8 ft. in height.

- [Bugbear](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Bugbear): **HD** 3+1; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 1 bite (2d4) or weapon (1d8+1); **Move** 9; **Save** 14; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: Surprise opponents, 50% chance.

### Bulette

Roughly ten feet in height, a bulette (boo-LAY) is covered in natural armor plating like that of an armadillo, and has a beak-like head that opens to show wicked, serrated teeth. These creatures can leap to the attack; in which case they cannot bite, but may attack with all four claws. Bulettes dig underground to surprise their prey, leaving a furrow in the ground as they go, caused by a dorsal crest in the creature’s armor. These voracious hunters eat horses and halflings with gusto, although they will devour anything from badgers to plowshares if their preferred foods are not readily available. Although bulettes burrow, they do not venture further underground, for they are surface predators. When the dorsal crest of the bulette is raised (during combat this is usually only after the thing has been wounded), the area underneath is AC 6 \[13\], and this vulnerable point can be attacked if the monster is well enough surrounded for its opponents to attack from behind as well as in front.

Bulettes, often called “landsharks,” resemble huge armadillos with wide, tooth-filled mouths. They burrow beneath the ground, and surge upward to attack prey. Bulettes can grow to be ten to fifteen feet long. Horses are a favorite food of bulettes.

### Bumblebee, Giant

#### Worker

Giant bees live in enormous hives in massive tress, along cliffs or even tunneled through soil. A hive can hold as many as 100 bees and always contains one queen. The poison of a bee does 2d6 points of damage if a saving throw is failed, 1d4 points of damage if the saving throw succeeds.

- Giant Bumblebee Worker: **HD** 3; **AC** 3\[16\]; **Attack** Sting (1d6 + poison); **Save** 14; **AL** N; **Move** 6 (Fly 18); **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: None

- Giant Bumblebee Queen: **HD** 10; **AC** 3\[16\]; **Attack** Sting (1d6 + poison); **Save** 5; **AL** N; **Move** 6 (Fly 18); **CL/XP** 12/2000; **Special**: None

### Bunyip

Bunyips are aquatic creature with the front half of a black seal and the rear half of a grayish-black shark. The bunyip is about 6 feet long, though specimens of up to 10 feet long have been encountered. Bunyips do not attack creatures larger than themselves, except in self-defense or if they detect blood in the water. A bunyip that detects blood in the water goes into a killing frenzy, as do all other bunyips within a 90-foot radius. Frenzied bunyips attack twice per round until either they or their opponents are dead. A frenzied bunyip’s swim speed increases to 24. This frenzy lasts for 10 rounds. When a bunyip roars, all creatures with 4 or less HD within a 100-foot spread must succeed on a saving throw or become panicked for 2d4 rounds, dropping their weapons and fleeing at top speed. If a bunyip scores a natural 20 on its attack roll, it severs one of the opponent’s extremities (roll 1d6: 1-3 arm, 4-6 leg; 50% chance of either right or left).

- Bunyip: **HD** 5 **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** Bite (1d6); **Move** (Swim 21); **Save** 12; **AL** N (L tendencies); **CL/XP** 7/600; **Special**: Frenzy, roar, vorpal bite

### Burning Dervish

Burning dervishes vary in appearance, but all resemble humans. Skin color, eye color, and hair color range across the same spectrum as that for normal humans. It is said that the burning dervishes were once a noble tribe of jann who sold their souls to the Sultan of Efreet in exchange for greater power over the Elemental Plane of Fire. Burning dervishes can shift into a flame form that resembles a column of fire to deal fire damage with each slam or weapon attack. Each day, a burning dervishes can become *invisible* 3 times, cast *pyrotechnics* 3 times, cast *enlarge* twice and cast *produce flame* twice. They can also transport themselves and up to eight creatures to any elemental plane, the Astral Plane or the Material Plane.

- Burning Dervish: **HD** 8 **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 1 weapon (1d6 + 1d6 fire); **Move** 9 (Fly 6); **Save** 8; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 9/1100; **Special**: Flame form, spell abilities, resist fire

### Cadaver

Cadavers are humanoids dressed in tattered rags. Rotted flesh reveals corded muscles and sinew stretched tightly over its skeleton. Hollow eye sockets flicker with an unholy fire of orange or yellow light. The cadaver’s mouth is lined with jagged and broken teeth, and its hands end in wicked claws. The creature’s claws and bite transmit horrible diseases that waste victims’ flesh (1d4 hit points damage; save resists). When killed, a cadaver regenerates 1 hit point per round. It stands up ready to fight again when it regains its full hit points. Damage caused by spells is not restored.

- Cadaver: **HD** 2 **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d4 + disease) and bite (1d6 + disease); **Move** 6; **Save** 16; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: Disease, reanimation

### Cadaver Lord

Cadavers lords are humanoids wearing tattered rags. Rotted flesh reveals corded muscles and sinew stretched tightly over its skeleton. Hollow eye sockets flicker with an unholy fire of orange or yellow light. The cadaver lord’s mouth is lined with jagged and broken teeth, and its hands end in wicked claws. The creature’s claws and bite transmit horrible diseases that waste victims’ flesh (1d4 hit points damage; save resists). When killed, a cadaver lord regenerates 1 hit point per round. It stands up ready to fight again when it regains its full hit points. Damage caused by spells is not restored. A creature slain by a cadaver lord awakens in 1d4 rounds as a cadaver. The cadaver lord can command any undead to do its bidding. Once per day, a cadaver lord can cast *darkness (15-foot radius)* and *fear*.

- Cadaver Lord: **HD** 5 **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d4 + disease) and bite (1d6 + disease); **Move** 9; **Save** 12; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 7/600; **Special**: Disease, reanimation, create spawn, command undead, magical abilities, spell resistance (20%), +1 magic weapons to hit

### Camel

Camels can carry 600 pounds of weight. They often have bad dispositions, and they spit.

- Camel: **HD** 2; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d2); **Move** 20; **Save** 16; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 2/30; **Special**: None.

### Carbuncle

Deep in the tangled underbrush of forests and in the remote regions of dismal swamps and bogs lives a strange creature called the carbuncle. The carbuncle resembles a cross between an anteater and armadillo with a large, red jewel embedded in its head. The carbuncle is a withdrawn creature and seeks to avoid encounters. Should it seek interaction, a carbuncle often begins by proudly announcing the value of the gem in its forehead just to watch the reaction such information arouses. Despite its overall shy nature, the carbuncle has a mischievous side as well, often seeking to join travelers in order to play pranks and gauge the reactions of the unfortunate victims of its curiosity. After joining with a party, a carbuncle will seek to cause discord by using selective telepathic images and prophesies to breed hostility and suspicion between party members. These images can be created once per round in the mind of a single creature within 30 feet of the carbuncle. Affected creatures must pass a saving throw or fall into loud bickering and arguing with those around them. If the affected creatures have different alignments, there is a 50% chance that they attack each other. Carbuncles might also telepathically contact nearby monsters and lead them to attack the party so that it can watch in fascination and read the thoughts of the party as they are attacked, slipping away at an opportune moment. A carbuncle can be coerced to surrender the gem in its forehead with some difficulty and much deception. When a carbuncle is slain, its forehead gem crumbles to dust. If the carbuncle relinquishes its gem, it grows another one within one month. Carbuncles enjoy watching others fight, but avoids engaging in combat itself.

- Carbuncle: **HD** 1: **AC** 1 \[18\]; **Atk** Bite (1d2); **Move** 9; **Save** 17; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 2/30; **Special**: Discord, foresight, telepathy 100 ft.

### Carrion Creeper

This caterpillar-like creature has 6 waving tentacles which, when they score a hit, require the target to make a saving throw or be paralyzed for 2d6 turns. These underground scavengers can be aggressive when they are hungry. amd tjeu will pursue prey unless distracted. They are good climbers, but when crossing water they are unable to do much more than float with the current.

- Carrion Creeper: **HD** 2+4; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** bite (1hp) 6 tentacles; **Move** 12; **Save** 14; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: Tentacles cause paralysis.

### Carrion Fly

<img width="359" height="400" src=":/d91bfa59a4594ac29acb98c5a97c29b9"/>

A carrion fly is 5 feet long and resembles a large, white grub with wings and no legs. Its head has large black eyes and a small mouth ringed with four long tentacles. It attacks with its tentacles, attempting to paralyze its prey. Once its victim is paralyzed, it will land and begin vomiting digestive acids to melt the victim into a suitable meal of goo. It can also spit these digestive acids at its target from a distance. *(Author: the Lizard of Oz).*

- [Carrion Fly](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Carrion-Fly): **HD** 4; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 4 tentacles (paralyze) or 1 spit (2d4); **Move** 3 (fly 18); **Save** 13; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 7/600; **Special**: Paralyze, acid

### Carrion Moth

Carrion moths resemble giant moths with long, beautiful wings covered in rippling patterns resembling skulls. Its head is centipede-like, with four long tentacles surrounding its mouth, which has a single pair of needle-like mandibles. Just as the caterpillar grows into a moth, sages believe the carrion crawler eventually sheds its form and transforms into the carrion moth. The carrion moth grows to a maximum length of 20 feet. Its wings are lined with tiny holes and veins that allow the carrion moth to emit a whining drone that affects all creatures that hear it. Affected creatures must pass a saving throw or be *confused* (as the spell) for 2d4 rounds. Creatures hit by the carrion moth’s tentacles must pass a saving throw or be paralyzed for 2d6 rounds. Carrion moths are attracted to the stench of decaying flesh and the light of anything larger than a torch or lantern. When a carrion moth dies, its carcass splits open and releases a foul-smelling gas. All living creatures (except other carrion moths) within 5 feet of the carcass must succeed on a saving throw or be nauseated for 1d4+1 rounds.

- Carrion Moth: **HD 5**: **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 4 tentacles (paralysis) and bite (1d6); **Move** 12 (Fly 24); **Save** 12; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: Drone, paralysis, stench

### Caryatid Column

A caryatid column is akin to the stone golem in that it is a magical construct created by a spellcaster. They look like exquisitely sculpted and chiseled statues of beautiful female warriors carrying longswords. The longsword is constructed of steel, but is melded with the column and made of stone until the column animates. Caryatid columns are programmed as guardians and activate when certain conditions or stipulations are met or broken (such as a living creature enters a chamber guarded by a caryatid column). It does not move more than 50 feet from the area it is guarding or protecting. They are immune to all spells except *transmute rock to mud*, which deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level to the caryatid column, *transmute mud to rock*, which heals the caryatid column of all damage and *stone to flesh*, which makes it subject to normal damage from weapons and suspends its immunity to magic for 1 round. Whenever a weapon strikes the caryatid column, the wielder must pass a saving throw or the weapon shatters into pieces. Magic weapons add their enchantment bonus to the saving throw.

- Caryatid Column: **HD** 5: **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** Longsword (1d8+1); **Move** 9; **Save** 12; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 7/600; **Special**: Immune to magic, half damage from normal weapons, shatter weapons

### Cat, Feral Undead

Feral undead cats look like they were created by zombie-raising magic, but they are actually things quite unlike normal animated undead such as skeletons or zombies. These undead cats are possessed of an animal cunning akin to that of ghouls (although with less intelligence), and they are not slow moving as zombies are. Like ghouls, they tend to form into packs. If a person is scratched more than three times by undead feral cats (not necessarily the same one), he must make a saving throw or be paralyzed for 1d6 turns. After the first set of three scratches, every subsequent scratch requires a saving throw. *(Author: Matt Finch)*

- [Feral Undead Cat](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Cat-Feral-Undead): **HD** 1d4hp; **AC** 8 \[11\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1hp); **Move** 12; **Save** 18; **AL** N; **CL/XP** B/10; **Special**: Paralyzing scratch (after first 3 hits).

### Caterprism

A caterprism is a caterpillar made of crystal with hexagonal body segments and twelve sharply angled legs. Each body segment is about 2 feet long and contains a single pair of legs. The head of a caterprism is caterpillar-like, with large faceted eyes and huge mandibles. Three times per day, a caterprism can spew forth a crystalline silk up to 20 feet that instantly solidifies into a rock-like substance. Creatures caught in the silk are impaled for 3d6 points of damage (save for half) as it hardens. The crystalline mandibles of a caterprism are extremely sharp. If a caterprism rolls a natural 20 with its bite attack, it severs the head of its opponent.

- Caterprism: **HD** 6: **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 4 legs (1d8) and bite (1d6); **Move** 9; **Save** 11; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: Crystal silk, crystalline mandibles

### Caterwaul

Caterwauls are semi-intelligent bipedal felines with dark, blue fur and long tails. Caterwauls are terribly quick, and they use this speed to run down their prey. The caterwaul’s lair is most often a cave littered with sticks, twigs, and leaves, with walls covered in scratch marks where the beast has honed its claws. Once every 10 rounds, a caterwaul can emit a piercing screech that deals 1d8 points of damage to all creatures within 60 feet that hear it. A creature that makes a successful saving throw takes half damage. About 1 in 6 caterwauls is so quick that it enjoys a +2 bonus to AC and can make an additional claw attack each round.

- Caterwaul: **HD** 5: **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d4) and bite (1d6); **Move** 21 (Climb 9); **Save** 12; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 6/400; **Special**: Screech

### Catoblepas

These medieval monsters resemble giant warthogs, but they are so hideous that their appearance can cause death (saving throw). If the first glance doesn’t kill, each round of viewing the beast can still stun the viewer into immobility for 1d3 turns.

- [Catoblepas](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Catoblepas): **HD** 6; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 11; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: Lethal appearance.

### Cattle

Cattle include oxen and cows. Bulls inflict 1d8 points of damage instead of 1d6.

- Cow/Ox: **HD** 3; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 1 gore (1d6); **Move** 18; **Save** 14; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**: None.

### Cave Cricket

Cave crickets are larger versions of normal crickets (3 feet long) and, much like the smaller crickets they resemble, are relatively harmless. The cave cricket’s chirping can be heard to a range of 300 feet. Creatures within 20 feet of a chirping cave cricket cannot be heard unless they scream. Spellcasters in the area must succeed on a saving throw to successfully cast a spell. The chirping increases the chance of wandering monsters by 30%. Cave cricket usually avoid combat, making a couple kick attacks against an attacker and then fleeing.

- Cave Cricket: **HD** 1: **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 2 kicks (1d4); **Move** 12; **Save** 17; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 1/15; **Special**: Chirp

### Cave Eel

Cave eels burrow through stone with sharp teeth, but otherwise look like large eels. They usually attack by reaching from their burrows in cave walls to bite. In general, these creatures congregate in groups.

- Cave eel: **HD** 2; **AC** 8 \[11\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d6); **Move** 1; **Save** 16; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 2/30; **Special**: Strike from cave walls.

### Cave Fisher

The cave fisher is a 7-foot long insect-like creature with a hard outer shell. It has eight legs, two of which end in serrated pincers. The cave fisher’s snout fires a strong, web-like adhesive filament it uses to reel in its prey. The cave fisher lairs on ledges and cliffs underground, where it can quickly strike and reel in its prey. Its lair is always littered with bones and gear from its previous victims. Often, the ground and walls nearby are covered with this filament. The cave fisher’s preferred method of attack is to anchor itself to its ledge and string its filament across the ground of its lair. When a living creature touches or passes near the filament (1 in 6 chance of spotting the filament, 2 in 6 for elves), the fisher attempts to trap it and reel it in. If the cave fisher fails this, it can fire its filament at an opponent up to 60 feet away. If a cave fisher hits with its filament attack, the filament latches onto the opponent’s body. This deals no damage but drags the stuck opponent 10 feet closer each subsequent round unless that creature breaks free. An application of liquid with high alcohol content dissolves the adhesive and forces the cave fisher to release its hold. The filament has 10 hit points and is AC 2 \[17\]. If the filament is severed, it grows back within 1 hour.

- Cave Fisher: **HD** 3: **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** Filament (see text) and 2 claws (1d6); **Move** 6; **Save** 14; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: Filaments

### Cave Leech

Cave leeches measure about 8 feet long and have a flattened semi-translucent body colored a sickly yellow or pale gray. Eight whip-like tentacles, each about 6 feet long protrude from the cave leech’s body near its head. These tentacles contain rigid hairs that let the cave leech drain 1d4 hit points worth of blood with each strike. Hundreds of smaller tentacles line its body and aid in locomotion. The cave leech has a large, round mouth ringed with dozens of razor-like teeth.

- Cave Fisher: **HD** 5: **AC** 9 \[10\]; **Atk** 8 tentacles (1d4 blood drain) or bite (1d6); **Move** 3; **Save** 12; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 6/400; **Special**: Blood Drain

### Cave Moray

Cave morays are not related to moray eels, their name coming instead for a similarity in ferocity and habit between the two creatures. The cave moray is a slug-like creature, brownish-gray in color, about 5 feet long and 1 foot thick. Cave morays make their lairs underground in abandoned mines, dungeons, or natural occurring caves, usually near corridors, hallways or other areas of high traffic. Its lair is a burrow, just large enough for its body dug into the walls. Only one cave moray inhabits each burrow. Cave morays wait in their burrows, usually with a fellow on the opposite side of the passage, to ambush anyone walking down their passage. Cave morays enjoy a +1 bonus to hit when they attack a surprised opponent.

- Cave Fisher: **HD** 4: **AC** 1 \[18\]; **Atk** Bite (1d6); **Move** 6; **Save** 13; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: Recoil attack, surprise on 1-3 on 1d6

### Centaur

Half man, half horse, centaurs are fierce warriors and well-known creatures of mythology. The referee may choose any “version” of the centaur from myth or folklore for his campaign: some are evil, some aloof, and some are soothsayers.

- [Centaur](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Centaur): **HD** 4; **AC** 5 \[14\] or 4 \[15\] with shield; **Atk** 2 kicks (1d6) and weapon; **Move** 18; **Save** 13; **AL** Any; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: None.

### Centipede Nest (Swarm)

A nesting of centipedes is a vast collection of normal centipedes, often combined with a few other sorts of bugs that tend to share the same living space: cockroaches and spiders, generally. Such vermin are not appreciably dangerous individually, but when a great number of them are disturbed at once they can present a serious threat. A party will normally encounter a nest of centipedes by accidentally disturbing the nest itself. Moving large wooden beams and prying into ancient masonry entail the risk of arousing one of these huge colonies. The centipedes of the nest are treated, for the sake of convenience, as a single monster. The nesting’s hit dice represent the amount of damage required to scatter and kill enough of the swarming vermin so that, as a group, they no longer pose a threat.

If a nest of centipedes manages to swarm over a character (either by landing on him or by moving around him), that character will sustain 1hp of damage per round automatically from the resulting bites. Moreover, even if the character subsequently moves away from the central mass of the nest, he will continue to sustain 1 hp of damage per round until a total of three rounds have been spend picking away and killing the centipedes which remain on him. Other characters may assist with this task, each lessening the time required by one round.

A centipede nest is immune to any damage other than that caused by a bludgeoning weapon such as a mace (although the mere expedient of kicking and stomping can inflict 1d2 hps damage with a successful hit). Any spell which affects an area rather than a single target (such as burning hands) will inflict double damage. For every five hit points of damage inflicted by a nest of centipedes against a single opponent, there is enough poison injected into the victim’s body to cause paralysis for 3-12 turns. Fortunately, the poison is relatively weak (+2 on saving throw). *(Author: Matt Finch - First appeared in Monsters of Myth, published by First Edition Adventure Games.)*

- Centipede Nest (Swarm): **HD** 3; **AC** 7\[12\]; **Atk** 1 (1hp + non-lethal poison); **Move** 3; **Save** 14; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: Immune to all but blunt weapons, non-lethal poison.

### Centipedes, Giant

#### Centipede, Giant (Small, Lethal)

Lethal giant centipedes of the small size inflict a deadly bite (+4 bonus to saving throw), but cause no damage if the saving throw is successful.

- Giant Centipede (small, lethal): **HD**: 1d2; **AC** 9 \[10\]; **Atk** 1 bite (0 + poison); **Move** 13; **Save** 18; **AL** N; **CL/XP**1/15; **Special** poison bite (+4 save or die)

#### Centipede, Giant (Small, Non-lethal)

The non-lethal variety of giant centipede has a painful bits but its poison is only crippling, not lethal. Failing a saving throw (at a +4 bonus) against the poison of this centipede causes 1d4 rounds of crippling pain (the victim is helpless, as when asleep). Additionally, the limb (roll 1d4) is temporarily crippled (treat as a disease) for 2d4 days. A crippled leg reduces movement by 50%; a crippled shield arm cannot wield weapon or shield; a crippled sword arm attacks at -4. A second bite on a leg reduces movement to one quarter normal, and a third bite to the legs reduces movement to 1 foot per minute (prone, dragging oneself by the arms).

- Giant Centipede (small, non-lethal): **HD**: 1d2; **AC** 9 \[10\]; **Atk** 1 bite (0 + poison); **Move** 13; **Save** 18; **CL/XP** B/10; **Special** Non-lethal poison bite, +4 save;

#### Centipede, Giant (Man-sized)

The man-sized giant centipede is a deadly predator with armored segments, a strong bite, and a lethal (though relatively weak) poison.

- Man-sized Giant Centipede (7ft): **HD**: 2; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d8 + poison); **Move** 15; **Save** 16; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special** Poison bite (+6 save or die)

#### Centipede, Giant (Large, 20 ft. long)

A twenty-foot long horror of chitin, multiple legs, and clashing pincers dripping with venom.

- Large Giant Centipede (20 ft.): **HD**: 4; **AC** 0 \[19\]; **Atk** 1 bite (3d8); **Move** 18; **Save** 13; **AL** N; **CL/XP 6/400; Special** Poison bite (+4 save or die).

### Cerberus

The triple-headed Cerberus (there is thankfully only one) is the guardian of Hades. He appears as a 10-foot long, three-headed black mastiff of the Molossian breed. Cerberus is tasked with the duty of keeping dead souls in Hades. If a dead soul attempts to pass beyond the Gates of Hades and back into the land of the living, Cerberus attacks relentlessly until that soul returns to Hades. If slain, the soul is immediately devoured by Cerberus and is lost forever. Cerberus is also tasked with keeping living creatures out of the land of the dead (adventurers being what they are, they love to journey to Hades). Living creatures that attempt to move past Cerberus into Hades (through the main gates) are immediately attacked.

Cerberus has a variety of potent attacks with which to carry out his duties. He usually begins a combat with a terrible, hair-raising howl that causes panic in those who hear it and fail a saving throw. This panic lasts for 2d4 rounds. Cerberus’ saliva carries a deadly poison. The dog’s center head can spit a stream of poison to a range of 30 feet. A creature meeting the gaze of all three heads must make a saving throw or be turned to stone (basalt, to be precise).

Cerberus is immune to any extraordinary, spell-like, or supernatural effect or spell that would teleport him or move him from his current location. Only deities can affect him with such magic. He is immune to death effects and disintegration and takes only half damage from acid, cold, electricity and fire.

- Cerberus: **HD** 20 (120 hp): **AC** 0 \[19\]; **Atk** 3 bites (3d6); **Move** 24; **Save** 3; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 29/6100; **Special**: Breath weapon, howl, petrifying gaze, poisonous bite, +1 or better weapon to hit, regenerate 1d6 hit points per round, magic resistance (20%)

### Cerebral Stalker

Cerebral stalkers are 6-foot tall bipedal creatures with blackish-gray scales covering their semi-reptilian form. A thick layer of mucus and slime drips from the creature’s body. The cerebral stalker’s bestial head sports vertical-slitted eyes of dull gray and a mouth filled with jagged teeth. Its hands are large and end in sharpened claws. A creature slain by a cerebral stalker’s bite attack has its brain ripped out and consumed. The empty husk becomes a zombie in 1d4 rounds. A cerebral stalker’s gaze instills fear (as per the spell of the same name) and three times per day, it can shoot sticky webbing from its body (as per a *web* spell).

- Cerebral Stalker: **HD** 9: **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d6+2) or bite (1d8+2); **Move** 6 (Burrow 3); **Save** 6; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 11/1700; **Special**: Consume brain, create zombie, fear gaze, web

### Chain Worm

A chain worm is a massive centipede with a bright, reflective silver carapace. Its legs are dull silver and its oversized mandibles are black. A dull black stinger is located at the rear of its body. Chain worms stand nearly 6 feet tall and are about 10 feet long. By rapidly vibrating its carapace, a chain worm emits a high-pitched trilling sound that stuns and deafens all creatures within 30 feet (save resists).

- Chain Worm: **HD** 12: **AC** 1 \[18\]; **Atk** 1 bite (2d6) and tail sting (2d6 + poison); **Move** 9 (Climb 6); **Save** 3; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 12/2000; **Special**: Poison, trilling

### Chalkeion (Men of Bronze)

The proud Men of Bronze are legendary for their martial prowess and ferocity. They appear as normal men (albeit unusually handsome and well proportioned normal men) with a deep reddish-brown skin tone and are typically armed and dressed in antique fashion. The chalkeions are the last remnants of a former age, and those few who remain make their living as mercenaries, for they crave battle above all things. Their flesh is not literally bronze, but it is exceptionally tough, giving them a natural armor class of 5\[14\]. In battle, they usually wear leather armor and shields (which improves their **AC** to 2\[17\]), carry spears and javelins, and do not typically ride horses. In melee chalkeions function as berserkers, gaining 2 attacks per round and never needing to check morale. Because of their fearlessness and strict discipline they are highly sought after as mercenaries, but it is also well known that the men of bronze place loyalty to their brethren and self preservation above their employers’ interests and will not obey orders which they perceive as foolish or suicidal. For every 6 men of bronze encountered there will typically be a sergeant with 6 hit dice, for every 12 a lieutenant with 7 or 8 hit dice, and groups of 30 or more are typically led by a captain with 10-12 hit dice. *(Author: Trent Foster).*

- Man of Bronze (hoplite): **HD** 5; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 2 by weapon (1d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 12; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: None.
- Man of Bronze (sergeant): **HD** 6; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 2 by weapon (1d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 11; **AL N; CL/XP** 6/400; **Special**: None.
- Man of Bronze (lieutenant): **HD** 7; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 2 by weapon (1d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 9; **AL N; CL/XP** 7/600; **Special**: None.
- Man of Bronze (captain): **HD** 11; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 2 by weapon (1d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 4; **AL N; CL/XP** 11/1700; **Special**: None.

### Chaos Knight

The Chaos Knight appears to be a faintly glowing, ghostly suit of animated armor. It seems insubstantial, but has a definite physical presence. There are no features to be discerned within its helm, save for a dim blue glow. Intense cold radiates from the Chaos Knight; any fire within 20ft will be dampened or doused, and liquids will cool and turn to ice.

The mere touch of a Chaos Knight is freezing cold, chilling those it touches to the bone. It wields a sword in melee, drawing upon otherworldly might to inflict extra damage

By concentrating for one round, a Chaos Knight may pass through solid objects such as a wall, leaving an icy outline where it has done so (3/day). It can cast Wall of Ice (3/day), cause shafts of ice to erupt from the ground (3/day), and open a portal similar to a Dimension Door spell (3/day). The portal remains open for up to 10 rounds, and anyone looking at it will see a kaleidoscopic passage of jagged energy bolts and whirling, ever-changing elemental matter. Any being other than the Chaos Knight that passes through the portal suffers 10 points of damage per round. The Chaos Knight may pass back and forth between the two end-points of the portal at will. It may also use Telekinesis once per day, and invoke a random spell effect twice per day.The Chaos Knight is immune to mind-affecting magic, as well as attacks from non-magical weapons. Normal weapons with a Bless spell cast upon them can hit and damage a chaos knight. *(Author: Scott Wylie Roberts, "Myrystyr").*

- [Chaos Knight](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Chaos-Knight): **HD** 10; **AC** 0 \[19\]; **Atk** 1 touch (1d6), or sword (1d8+8); **Move** 12 (Fly 4); **Save** 5; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 14/2600; **Special**: Special dimension door, wall of ice, spikes of ice, pass through walls, telekinesis, random spell effect, immune to non-magical weapons.

### Cherum

This hairless mountain of slick raw burning flesh constantly sizzles and oozes with the stench of burning fat. Two long meaty arms sprout from a hugely obese frame; its head appears to be little more than a bald sloping brow with black pits for eyes. Its maw splits open to reveal cavernous jaws, teeth glowing like huge red hot coals. A cherum stands about 70 feet tall and weighs well over 40,000 pounds. Anyone within 40 feet of a cherum takes 6d6 points of fire damage each round (save for half) from the blazing heat radiating off the creature’s body. If a cherum rolls a natural 20 on its bite attack, it swallows an opponent whole and does an automatic 4d6 points of damage each round to the creature. Cherum’s heal 5 hit points per round while touching flame or lava.

- Cherum: **HD** 24: **AC** -3 \[22\]; **Atk** 2 claws (2d8 + 1d6 fire) and bite (4d6 + 1d6 fire); **Move** 6; **Save** 3; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 27/6500; **Special**: Fiery aura, swallow whole, regenerate 5 hp/round, immune to fire and poison, vulnerable to cold, spell resistance (30%)

### Chimera

The chimera has three heads; one is the head of a goat, one the head of a lion, and one the head of a dragon. Great wings rise from its lion-like body. The dragon head can breathe fire (3 times per day) with a range of 50ft, causing 3d8 damage to anyone caught within the fiery blast (saving throw for half damage).

- [Chimera](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Chimera): **HD** 9; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d3), 2 goat horns (1d4), 1 [lion](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Lion) bite (2d4), [dragon](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Dragons) bite (3d4); **Move** 9 (Fly 18); **Save** 6; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 11/1700; **Special**: Breathes fire.

### Chrystone

Chrystones are humanoid creatures made of rock and crystal that normally stand just over 5 feet tall. Their coloration varies by the types of crystal and rock they absorb, giving each chrystone a unique pattern of striations and coloration that makes them easy to tell apart. Originally imbued with life by a spellcaster in a ritual involving the blood of several dragons and a demon, chrystones grow new offspring through budding. To form a new bud, a chrystone must consume several times its weight in crystals and consume at least 300 gp worth of gems. The bud continues to grow from the chrystone’s back until it is large enough to separate. Each chrystone offspring retains the memories and knowledge of its entire parental line.

In battle, a chrystone can exhale a 20-foot cone of rainbow colors up to three times per day. Creatures with 2 HD or less are blinded and knocked unconscious for 2d4 rounds and remain blinded for an additional 1d4 rounds after regaining consciousness. Creatures with 3 or more HD are blinded for 1d4 rounds. Sightless creatures are not affected by the chrystone’s breath weapon.

Chrystones can use the *stone shape* spell at will and the stone tell spell twice per day. They are immune to all spells save *transmute rock to mud*, which slows them for 2d6 rounds, *transmute mud to rock*, which restores all lost hit points to them, *stone shape*, which acts as a *cure light wounds* spell, and *stone to flesh*, which does not turn them into flesh, but does negate their immunity to magic for 1 round.

Whenever a character strikes a chrystone with a weapon (magical or nonmagical), the wielder must succeed on a saving throw or shatter into pieces. A magic weapon adds its own bonus to the saving throw. If the weapon breaks, the chrystone takes no damage from the attack.

When a chrystone is destroyed, it shatters, spraying razor-sharp fragments from its form. Creatures within 5 feet of the chrystone take 2d6 points of damage. A saving throw halves the damage.

- Chrystone: **HD** 5: **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** Longsword (1d8); **Move** 9; **Save** 12; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: Breath weapon, spells, immune to magic, resistance to non-magical weapons (50%), shatter weapons

### Chupacabra

The chupacabra is a fur-covered bipedal creature is 3 or 4 feet tall with a hunched back, red eyes, and a mouth filled with sharpened teeth. A flexible rows of spines run down its back. Chupacabras are small terrifying bloodsuckers that lurk on the fringes of society, emerging at night to drain the blood of warm-blooded creatures. If a chupacabra hits a single opponent with both claws, it latches on and begins sucking the creatures blood with an automatic bite attack that does 1d4 points of damage each round thereafter. There is a 10% chance that any chupacabra encountered has wings (Fly 15).

- Chupacabra: **HD** 3: **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d3) and bite (1d4); **Move** 9; **Save** 14; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: Drain Blood

### Church Grim

Church grims are good sprits that guard cemeteries from those who seek to steal from the dead, or those who wish to desecrate the sanctity of the graves there. They appear as large black dogs, roving protectively among the tombstones at night. The eyes of a church grim see all evil that crosses into its territory, and it spares no mercy for such trespassers. The howl of a church grim causes any Chaotic creature to save or flee in terror for 2d4 rounds (save resists). Church grims are partly incorporeal, requiring +1 or better weapons to hit. A church grim that is destroyed reforms in 24 hours. *Animate dead* or similar spells to create undead fizzle when a church grim is around as the creature defends the dead souls under its protection.

- Church Grim: **HD** 5: **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** Bite (1d6); **Move** 15; **Save** 12; **AL** L; **CL/XP** 6/400; **Special**: Howl, +1 or better weapons to hit, soul defender

### Churr

Churrs are savage ape-like creatures found in heavily forested areas. They are fairly intelligent, standing 8 feet tall and weighing about 800 pounds. If a churr hits a single opponent with both claws, it grabs the foe and constricts for an additional 1d6 points of damage. A churr can unleash a frightening howl that causes all creatures within 60 feet to flee in fear (as per a *fear* spell) if they fail a save.

- Churr: **HD** 6: **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d6) and bite (1d6); **Move** 9 (Climb 6); **Save** 11; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 6/400; **Special**: Constrict, howl

### Clam, Giant

Giant clams are generally found in coastal waters no deeper than 60 feet from the surface of the water. Many species of giant clams subsist strictly on a diet of sunlight, and as such are never found in deeper waters where sunlight cannot reach. Such giant clams are generally found in shallow seas or attached to coral reefs near the surface. Other species of giant clams feed not only on sunlight but also on what they can filter from the water, usually small plants and animals, and sometimes the occasional swimmer. A giant clam moves by pushing out a small “foot” and sliding itself along. Victims of the giant clam’s bite attack must pass a saving throw or be swallowed. The giant clam uses a slow-acting acid to break down its meals, inflicting 1d2 points of damage each round. Victims lodged inside the creature can escape with a successful strength check. Otherwise, it opens on its own in 1d4 hours.

- Giant Clam: **HD** 4: **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** Bite (swallow); **Move** 3; **Save** 13; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: Acid, surprise on 1-3 on 1d6

**Giant Clam** from the [Tome of Horrors Complete](http://shop.d20pfsrd.com/products/sw-the-tome-of-horrors-complete), Copyright 2011, Necromancer Games, Inc., published and distributed by Frog God Games; Author Scott Greene, based on original material by Gary Gygax.

### Clamor

A clamor is a strange, extraplanar creature composed entirely of sound waves. Normally invisible, a clamor looks like a field of shifting patterns of vibrations and oscillations approximately 5 feet across and about as tall. Clamors can perfectly mimic any sound they encounter. Clamors tend to avoid combat, instead staying back and “playing back” any sound they hear. If attacked, the clamor blasts opponents with a high frequency sonic beam. If overwhelmed, it uses its sonic burst to escape. This burst of sound can be heard for miles. Any creature within 100 feet of the clamor must save or be stunned for 1d3 rounds. Anyone within 50 feet must save or be permanently deafened. If attacked, the clamor focuses its sonic ray on the opponent.

- Clamor: **HD** 4: **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** sonic ray (2d6); **Move** (Fly 24); **Save** 13; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 7/600; **Special**: Sonic burst, mimic, +2 magic weapons to hit, invisibility

### Clawed Fiend

![](:/8959933365814b1fb869603baca95dc7)

Clawed fiends are 5-ft. tall, pale green humanoids. Their legs are short stumps and their hairless facial features carry a distinctive frog-like cast (large, bulbous eyes, wide mouth). This creature is so named because of its absurdly long arms which end in long, viciously sharp claws. The arms themselves extend to 5-ft, with the claws reaching 2 to 3 feet. With such a long range, the clawed fiend isn’t limited to attacking foes directly in front of it, but may also attack those up to 8ft away. Although clawed fiends can inflict devastating damage on their foes by way of their vicious claws, they are slow critters, and are penalized with a -1 to initiative rolls. Without the digits required for fine manipulation, clawed fiends are unable to employ weapons of any kind. *(Author Skathros)*

- [Clawed Fiend](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Clawed-Fiend): **HD** 2; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d8/1d8); **Move** 3; **Save** 16; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 2/30; **Special**: -1 to initiative.

### Cliessid

The amphibious Cliessid are small, shelled humanoids with pincers in place of hands, three thick toes on each leg in a Y-shape, and a mass of writhing tentacles in place of a head. They stand no taller than a man’s knee. Cliessids live in sluggish rivers, shallow streams, stagnant ponds, and sewer systems, and can move as fast in, or under, the water as on land. Some cities have imported and domesticated these creatures for use in sewer maintenance, but with mixed results, for cliessids are viciously hostile to any who invade their territory. *(Auhtor: Scott Wylie Roberts, "Myrystyr").*

- [Cliessid](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Cliessid): **HD** 1d4hp; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 2 pincers (1hp); **Move** 9 (Swim 9); **Save** 18; **AL** N; **CL/XP** A/5; **Special**: None.

### Cloaker

Cloakers are manta-like creatures that resemble a large black cloak – the ivory claws are often even mistaken for a clasp of some kind, as they are kept folded when the cloaker is at rest. Unfurled, the cloaker has a span of about eight feet.

Cloakers can attempt to enfurl their opponents during melee combat, while attacking. If the cloaker hits with its attempt to enfold a target, the victim is clasped in the cloaker’s manta-like body (a saving throw allows the victim to escape). The victim is allowed no further saving throws to escape, although it is possible to attack the cloaker with a dagger from within its folds. The cloaker can bite an enfolded opponent with a +4 bonus to hit.

Perhaps more dangerous than the cloaker’s ability to enfold an opponent is its ability to moan, for the cloaker’s moaning is dire indeed, causing a petrifying fear. Anyone hearing the moan of a cloaker must make a saving throw or do one of two things (50% chance of each): either flee at top speed for 1d6 turns, or be immobilized with fear for 1 turn.

Finally, cloakers have the ability to manipulate darkness and shadows. They can cause *darkness 15-ft. radius* whenever desired, and as long as shadows or darkness are present, they can create shadowy *mirror images* of themselves (as per the spell) once per day (1d4 images).

- Cloaker: **HD** 6; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** Tail (1d8), bite (1d6), enfurl; **Move** 9 (Fly 12); **Save** 11; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: Moan, mirror image, darkness, enfurl.

### Clockworks

Clockworks are the creations of powerful machines called brain gears. Each clockwork creature varies from its brethren and each is assigned a task by the brain gear that created it. Clockworks are automatons and follow orders without question. It is through these various clockwork creations that brain gears seek to destroy all living creatures. They come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes.

The clockwork creations controlled by a brain gear share several characteristics. Most constructs are immediately destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points. Clockworks with the self-repair special quality, however, are not destroyed at 0 or less hit points. While they do cease to function, they continue to self-repair, only at a slower rate. Once it has self-repaired itself to at least 1 hit point, the clockwork begins functioning normally again.

Some clockworks (see below) can automatically repair themselves with spare parts and scrap, and a built-in mechanism allows them to self-repair even when seemingly destroyed. The clockwork automatically heals damage at a fixed rate per round, as given in the clockwork’s entry. Certain attack forms, typically acid, cold, and fire cannot be self-repaired. The clockwork’s descriptive text describes the details.

A clockwork with self-repair can repair lost limbs (including its head), but it takes 3d6 rounds to do so. A clockwork reduced to 0 or less hit points is not destroyed, but begins to self-repair damage at one-half its normal rate (minimum 1 hit point per round). It still cannot repair damage dealt by acid, cold, or fire effects. For example, a clockwork with self-repair 3 normally regains 3 hit points per round. If reduced to 0 or less hit points, it regains 1 hit point per round until it has at least 1 hit point (at which time it self-repairs at its normal rate).

#### Clockwork — Brain Gear

The original brain gear began as little more than a collection of gears, chains, counterweights, and levers, but was enhanced and grown into a controlling intellect through a process very similar to flesh golem creation. A brain gear in its true form resembles nothing more than a copper or gold box or cube that shines with a pale blue light. It is immobile, cannot attack, or speak. The casing of a brain gear is so hard that it ignores up to 5 points of damage from physical attacks.

A brain gear is designed to control the actions of all other clockworks created by its own creator, relieving the creator of having to oversee simple operations of the clockworks. It is rumored that some brain gears occasionally develop an evil intellect and turn their charges against its creator. Any clockwork that comes within two miles of a brain gear immediately falls under that brain gear’s control. If more than one brain gear attempts to control a clockwork (or if the clockwork is under the control of another brain gear or overseer), each gear must make a saving throw; the brain gear beating its saving throw by the most gains control of that clockwork.

When a clockwork moves more than 2 miles away from a brain gear, it continues to perform the last order given to it, but there is a 25% percent chance each hour that it ceases to function, collapsing into a pile of junk. If a brain gear later moves within two miles of the destroyed clockwork, the clockwork can reactivate if it has the self-repair ability. Otherwise, it remains destroyed.

A brain gear in control of at least one clockwork can use that clockwork to perceive the world through its senses. This ability has a range of 2 miles. A brain gear can switch control from one clockwork to another once per round. A brain gear uses this ability to give commands to its clockworks, allowing the usually mindless creatures to fight with highly coordinated tactics. Each clockwork is capable of receiving roughly 100 words worth of orders. Anything beyond that is too complicated for the clockwork to handle.

The brain gear has a limited ability to send psychic messages to multiple creatures of a particular type (human, ogre, etc) through their dreams.

The secrets of clockwork construction are known only to the brain gear and to those it employs.

- Clockwork - Brain Gear: **HD**: 5; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** None; **Move** 0; **Save** 12; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**: Control clockworks, dream

#### Clockwork Drone

Clockwork drones appear as human eyeballs encased within flat, metal disks. Imbued with magic that allows it to fly, a drone’s approach is announced by a low buzzing sound caused by its tiny gears and pistons working furiously to maintain this magical field. These clockworks are designed to act as observers. When a drone finds an advantageous position from which to maintain its watch, it uses a small, metallic claw on its underside to attach itself to a surface. Drones usually avoid combat at all costs. When they are pressed into fighting, they prefer to aid their fellow clockworks by distracting their enemies.

- Clockwork Drone: **HD**: 1d6; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** Slam (1d3); **Move** 9 (Fly 24); **Save** 18; **AL** N; **CL/XP** B/10; **Special**: None

#### Clockwork Overseer

Overseers are a recent invention of the brain gears. They look like three-foot tall wooden dolls with long, slender limbs. An overseer can journey up to 10 miles away from a brain gear while maintaining contact with it. An overseer acts as a field commander for brain gears, controlling up to 20 HD worth of clockworks that are within 100 feet of its position so long as the overseer remains within 10 miles of the brain gear. An overseer avoids direct combat at all costs under direct orders of a brain gear. If cornered with no way of escaping, an overseer fights, and attempts to flee as soon as possible.

- Clockwork Overseer: **HD**: 2; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** Slam (1d6); **Move** 15; **Save** 16; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 2/30; **Special**: None

#### Clockwork Parasite

Clockwork parasites are fist-sized constructs that resemble mechanical beetles. They burrow into the skulls of the recently dead and reanimate the body using electrical impulses to control and direct the corpse. The animated corpses look and fight like zombies, though they cannot be turned or controlled. A host brought to 0 or less hit points is destroyed, but can be repaired by the clockwork parasite using its self-repair ability (though this only works if the host is brought to 0 or less hit points; a host does not gain the self-repair ability of the parasite while “alive”). A clockwork parasite regains 3 hit points per round. Damage dealt from acid, cold, or fire effects cannot be self-repaired. If reduced to 0 or less hit points, it regains 1 hit point per round (but still cannot repair damage caused by acid, cold, or fire effects) until it has at least 1 hit point (at which time it begins to self-repair at its normal rate of 3 hit points per round).

- Clockwork Parasite: **HD**: 4; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** Bite (1d4); **Move** 9; **Save** 13; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Control host, self-repair

#### Clockwork Scout

Scouts are constructed to resemble animals commonly found in the area that the brain gear operates within. Their inner wood and metal workings are covered by an animal’s pelt. Characters have only a 1 in 6 chance to notice the deception (2 in 6 for demi-humans and 3 in 6 for druids and rangers). This camouflage helps them move about unnoticed and gives them the opportunity to strike from ambush. They are designed to serve as the mobile eyes and ears of a clockwork colony. While still restricted by the 2-mile radius they must remain within to keep contact with a brain gear, scouts serve an important role as reconnaissance, patrol, and pursuit troops. Only if the scouts have a chance to strike from a devastating ambush does the brain gear order them into battle.

- Clockwork Scout: **HD**: 1; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** Slam (1d4); **Move** 15; **Save** 17; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 1/15; **Special**: None

#### Clockwork Swarm

Clockwork swarms are a collection of tiny, insect-like clockworks that work together as a single creature. An individual member of the swarm poses little threat. Yet when acting in concert, a swarm poses a deadly threat to adventurers. Much like the clockwork warrior, the clockwork swarm forms a fighting frame from random pieces of trash, debris, and other cast-offs. The swarm, however, is much more capable of adapting to new situations and surviving combat. Unless the individual components of the swarm are destroyed, it simply reforms and continues its attack. Area of effect attacks, such as burning oil, *fireball*, or *lightning bolt* are the most effective means of destroying the swarm. A clockwork swarm typically appears as a ramshackle collection of spare parts and garbage draped in a thick, web-like substance and arranged in a vaguely humanoid form. Living creatures engulfed by the clockwork swarm must pass a saving throw or be unable to act during that round.

A clockwork swarm regains 3 hit points per round. Damage dealt from acid, cold, or fire effects cannot be self-repaired. If a clockwork swarm takes damage from an area attack, it is unable to repair itself for 1d6 rounds following the attack. If reduced to 0 or less hit points, it regains 1 hit point per round (but still cannot repair damage caused by acid, cold, or fire effects) until it has at least 1 hit point (at which time it begins to self-repair at its normal rate of 3 hit points per round).

- Clockwork Swarm: **HD**: 4; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** Swarm (1d6); **Move** 15; **Save** 13; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 7/600; **Special**: Distraction, minimum damage from slashing and piercing weapons, self-repair

#### Clockwork Titan

Clockwork titans are huge, crab-like mechanical monstrosities. They have saucer-shaped hulls set atop four spindly legs that allow it to move with surprising speed and agility. Two iron-shod fists are mounted on the front of the hull. The clockwork titan has a long reach, and can attack from behind a line of clockwork warriors.

- Clockwork Titan: **HD**: 7; **AC** 0 \[19\]; **Atk** Slam (2d8); **Move** 12; **Save** 9; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: None

#### Clockwork Warrior

Clockwork warriors are constructed from a wide range of materials but take the same general form of a 6-foot tall armored humanoid. They all feature a “nervous system” of thin steel wires that controls their individual pieces. Tiny clockworks that look much like metallic cockroaches infest the warrior, working to repair damage sustained by this construct. These tiny clockworks repair 1 hit point per round. Acid, fire, and cold effects destroy these maintenance clockworks, thus preventing the warrior from repairing damage from those sources. Unlike clockwork swarms (see below), the clockworks that repair the warrior lack the intelligence and sophistication to tackle any other task.

- Clockwork Titan: **HD**: 3; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** Slam (1d8); **Move** 9; **Save** 14; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: Self-repair

### Clockwork Bronze Giant

A clockwork bronze giant is a massive automaton standing 25 feet tall constructed entirely of bronze. Other clockwork giants are rumored to be crafted of iron, steel, bronze or other metals. Clockworks giants have no mind of their own and follow commands and orders given by their creator. Lightning heals a 3 hit points per level of the spell cast at a clockwork bronze giant. They are immune to all other spells.

- Clockwork Bronze Giant: **HD** 14: **AC** 0 \[19\]; **Atk** 1 Weapon (4d6 plus poison) or 1 fist (2d8); **Move** 12; **Save** 3; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 16/3200; **Special**: magic resistance (25%), +1 magic weapon needed to hit, throw rocks (2d8), lightning heals, immune to most spells

### Clubnek

A clubnek is a large flightless bird resembling a green ostrich with an oversized beak that it uses to pound and bite. Found roaming meadowlands and forests, it is primarily a herbivore subsisting on a diet of plants and flowers, though it is given to flights of unpredictability when it takes the role of hunter and predator. A clubnek stands 7 feet tall and weighs about 350 pounds. Clubneks are generally nonaggressive unless threatened or frightened, though they are known to occasionally have fits of erratic behavior that cause them to become quite aggressive. In such a case, they attack until slain or driven off. If its prey attempts to flee, the clubnek often runs it down and continues combat. Once every 5 rounds, a clubnek can move five times its normal speed when it makes a charge.

- Clubnek: **HD** 2: **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d4) and beak (1d6); **Move** 15; **Save** 16; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 2/30; **Special**: Burst of speed

### Cobra Flower

Cobra flowers are tall, slender plants with large, flowering bulbs and brownish-green roots. Two large, green leaves flank its flowering top, giving the appearance of a cobra’s hood. Its leaves are thin and have transparent blotches on them. Cobra flowers draw nutrients from sunlight, the soil, and water, but enjoy a diet of insects, rodents, animals, and even humans and demi-humans when available. The creatures can be found nesting in forests and often take up residence near small population areas where they can feed on humanoids who wander into their area. Many a child’s or adult’s disappearance can be attributed to a cobra flower. When a cobra flower detects a living creature, it remains motionless until its prey is within 5 feet. It then spreads its leafy hood, opens its flowery bulb, and bites its prey, secreting acidic enzymes to break down and digest the victim. Cobra flowers can also wrap their thick stems around an opponent with a successful attack, holding their prey still, squeezing them for 1d8 points of damage per round and increasing their chance to hit with their bite attack by +2.

- Cobra Flower: **HD** 6: **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** Bite (1d8 + 1d6 acid); **Move** 3; **Save** 11; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 7/600; **Special**: Squeeze

### Cockatrice

A cockatrice resembles a bat-winged rooster with a long, serpentine tail. Its bite turns enemies to stone unless a successful saving throw is made.

- [Cockatrice](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Cockatrice): **HD** 5; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d6 + turn to stone); **Move** 6 (Fly 18); **Save** 12; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: bite turns to stone.

### Coffer Corpse

The coffer corpse is an undead creature formed as the result of an incomplete death ritual. It looks like a desiccated corpse shrouded in rotting, tattered funerary clothes. It is often found haunting stranded funeral barges or in other situations where a corpse has not been delivered to its final resting place. The creature hates life and attacks living creatures on sight. In combat, coffer corpses attempt to grasp their opponents around the throat, strangling them for 1d6 damage per round. A creature in the coffer corpse’s death grip cannot cast spells and can only break free by rolling an open doors check on a d8. Coffer corpses can only be harmed by magic weapons, and suffer minimal damage from edged and piercing weapons. Any time an attack is successful, regardless of the weapon used, damage dice should be rolled. If apparent (or real, in the case of magical bludgeoning damage) is 6 or higher, the coffer corpse appears to fall to the ground, destroyed. If the horror had a victim in its death grip, it will release its hold and then fall to the ground. On its next turn, however, it will rise again as if reanimated. A creature viewing this apparent reanimation must make a saving throw or become panicked for 2d4 rounds.

- Coffer Corpse: **HD** 2: **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** Slam (1d6); **Move** 9; **Save** 16; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Death grip, weapon resistance, deceiving death, cause fear

### Colossus, Jade

Jade colossi are massive constructs standing 35 feet tall and weighing about 60,000 pounds. It appears as a massive humanoid carved of smooth green stone. Its body is made up of perfect angles and contours. A jade colossus pummels a foe with its hardened fists. Once every 1d4 rounds, a jade colossus can spray a blast of green energy in a 60-foot cone or 120-foot line that does 15d6 points of damage (save for half). A creature slain by this blast is transformed into jade. Disintegrate slows a jade colossus for 1d6 rounds, while fire heals the construct. It is immune to all other magic.

- Colossus, Jade: **HD** 30: **AC** -6 \[25\]; **Atk** 2 slams (4d8); **Move** 12; **Save** 3; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 36/9200; **Special**: Breath weapon, +3 weapons to hit, immune to fire, immune to magic

### Cooshee

Cooshees are large, 200-pound, 4-foot tall hounds with green and brown spotted fur, a long, curling tail and ears that taper to points. They are known throughout the world as elven dogs, for their features resemble those of elves and they are often found in the employ of elves (who use them as guards). Though they only bark to warn their masters or other cooshees, the bark can be heard clearly up to one mile away. Cooshees enjoy a +2 bonus to save vs. charm effects. Once per hour, they can sprint at 10 times their normal speed. The victim of a cooshee’s bite attack must pass a saving throw or be knocked prone.

- Cooshee: **HD** 3: **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d4) and bite (1d8); **Move** 15; **Save** 14 (12 vs. charm); **AL** N (L tendencies); **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: Sprint, trip, surprise on 1-3 on 1d6

### Coral Clamper

This mollusk resembles a growth of rock or coral covered with several large (but still normal-looking) clams. When a swimmer nears it, however, the clamper lashes out with long, flexible arms of muscle for which the “clams” are the tips. These appendages encircle and crush prey, with the clam-like tip serving as a viciously biting mouth. A coral clamper normally has four appendages, and these grow to a length of 20ft. The clamper’s body is protected by its hard, coral-like shell. If one of the appendages scores a hit, the victim must make a saving throw or be held helpless by the tentacle-like grasp. The clam-mouth at the end of the tentacle can attack while a victim is held, but cannot generally reach a victim other than the one held in the muscle-tentacle. *(Author: Matt Finch)*

- [Coral Clamper](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Coral-Clamper): **HD** 6; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 4 muscle-tentacles (1d6 + grab); **Move** 1; **Save** 11; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: Grab victims.

### Corpse Candle

A corpse candle appears as a translucent image of its living self. Its body shows little, if any, signs of death. Corpse candles can create dancing, twisting patterns of light that lure victims toward the colorful aura. A creature must save or be drawn onward – often into danger such as over cliffs, through fire or worse.

- Corpse Candle: **HD** 6: **AC** 8 \[11\]; **Atk** Incorporeal touch (1d6); **Move** 6 (Fly 18); **Save** 11; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: Hypnotic Lights

### Corpse Orgy

A corpse orgy is a large, undulating mass of rotting corpses, sinew, bones, blood, muscle, mucus, and organs. It resembles an ooze and has no discernible features (other than the corpse parts that make up its form). A corpse orgy can absorb the physical body of any creature it has reduced to 0 hit points by moving over it and remaining in contact with it for at least one full round. When it absorbs a body, the corpse orgy gains 12 temporary hit points. A creature whose body is absorbed can only be raised or resurrected if the corpse orgy that absorbed its body is slain and the corpse in question is recovered. Twice per day, a corpse orgy can unleash a piercing shriek from the various heads captured in its form that deals 8d6 points of damage to all creatures within a 40-foot radius (save for half).

- Corpse Orgy: **HD** 14: **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 4 slams (2d6); **Move** 6; **Save** 3; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 16/3200; **Special**: Absorb body, pain shriek, half damage from blunt weapons

### Corpse Rook

Corpse rooks resemble large three-headed ravens or crows. Their feathers are oily black in color and have a pungent, almost sulfuric, odor. Their beak and talons are bright silver and their eyes are golden. The creature’s wings are tipped with silver and the wingspan measures about 30 feet. From head to tail, the corpse rook is about 12 feet long. A corpse rook that hits with two or more bites on a single opponent latches on and tears at the victim’s flesh for an additional 2d8 points of damage.

- Corpse Rook: **HD** 6: **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d6) and 3 bites (1d8); **Move** 6 (Fly 24); **Save** 11; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 7/600; **Special**: Rend

### Corpse Tree

These stunted, gnarled trees look like worn down, time ravaged tree trunks ranging in height from 4 to 8 feet tall, with a corpse-like shape, arms stretched forth, budding from the trunk. Every corpse tree has a tree ghost (see below) that is part of it. Corpse trees are created when a vampire or wraith kills a dryad; the dryad’s tree becomes the corpse tree and the dryad herself becomes a tree ghost. At the base of the tree is an opening leading to a strange chamber beneath, where the corpse tree’s victims are slowly digested. The “rising corpse” part of the tree animates to keep anyone but the tree ghost and her victims from entering the tree’s chamber. A corpse tree can only harmed by magic and silver weapons. Magic fire will affect the tree but ice, electricity, and acid will have no effect, nor will normal fire. The tree ghost instantly knows of any harm coming to the corpse tree, and she can teleport to the tree to defend it against harm. If either the corpse tree or the tree ghost dies, the other will die as well.

*(Auhtor: Sean “Stonegiant” Stone).*

- Corpse Tree: **HD** 5 + 2 hp; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 2 fists (1d8); **Move** 0; **Save** 12; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 7/600; **Special**: If both fists hit the victim is “bear” hugged for an additional 2d6 damage; immune to to non-magical weapons, ice, electricity, acid, and normal fires.

### Corpsespinner

A corpsespinner is a huge tarantula-like creature, bone white in color with bands of gray, black, or silver ringing its abdomen and legs. The average corpsespinner is 15 feet long. Its body is covered in short, bristly hairs of white or silver. The corpsespinner has a skull-like marking on its thorax. Its eight eyes are silver, white, or gray. Creatures killed by a corpsespinner rise in 1 hour as corpsespun zombies. A corpsespinner’s bite delivers a toxic poison, and they can fire sticky strands of webbing up to 80 feet up to 10 times per day (otherwise similar to a *web* spell)

- Corpse Rook: **HD** 12: **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 1 bite (2d8 + poison); **Move** 9 (Climb 6); **Save** 3; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 13/2300; **Special**: Create corpsespun zombie, poison, web

### Couatl

Intelligent serpents with feathered wings, couatls can be fifteen feet long or more. They can polymorph themselves, constrict victims for 1d6 hit points, and cast spells (3 level 1, 2 level 2, 1 level 3). Generally tropical, some may be servitors of the gods.

- [Couatl](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Couatl): **HD** 8; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 1 bite (2d6 + poison), 1 tail (1d6 constrict); **Move** 12 (Fly 24); **Save** 8; **AL L; CL/XP** 11/1700; **Special**: Fly, poison (lethal), spells, polymorph.

### Crab, Giant

Larger specimens of giant crabs might move more slowly – these stats are for a crab about 5-ft. in diameter.

- [Giant Crab](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Crab-Giant): **HD** 3; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 2 pincers (1d6+2); **Move** 9; **Save** 14; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**: None.

### Crab, Monstrous

Monstrous crabs are omnivores and spend most of their time combing the ocean floors for food. Many act as vegetarians and sustain themselves on a diet of algae, fungus, and water-based plants, while others act as scavengers or predators. Some have been known to actively hunt giant clams and snails (the monstrous crab pries the shell open and devours the fleshy innards). Still others prefer to dwell in coastal waters and prey upon land-based creatures that wander too close to the shoreline. Monstrous crabs are often hunted as food by other races (particularly humans and sahuagin). They are about the size of a panther.

- Monstrous Crab: **HD** 3: **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d4); **Move** 12(Swim 9); **Save** 14; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**: None

### Crab Man

Crab men are bipedal creatures with a crab-like exoskeleton and a pincer at the end of each arm. They are tribal creatures, found living near water (including subterranean lakes and rivers).

- Crab men: **HD** 2; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d4); **Save** 16; **Move** 9 (swim 9); **AL** N; **CL/XP** 2/30; **Special**: None.

### Crabnipede

Crabnipedes are horrible sea creatures resembling man-sized centipedes with 4 pincers. They hunt on sea floors and lake bottoms, and can crawl out from the water for hours, if the hunting seems better on land. The crabnipede’s bite is mildly poisonous, causing paralysis for 1d6 turns (saving throw applies). *(Author: Matt Finch)*

- Crabnipede: **HD** 4; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 4 claws (1d4), 1 bite (1d6 + paralysis); **Move** 6 (Swim 12); **Save** 13; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Paralysis poison (1d6 turns).

### Crag Man

Sometimes called living stalagmites, crag men appear as a normal stalagmite. In humanoid form, a crag man is a 6-foot tall human-shaped creature seemingly carved from stone. It is thick and squat and its features are jagged and broken. Small depressions on its head function as eyes, though no pupils are present. The crag man has no ears. A ridge on its “face” running between its eyes serves as a nose and its mouth is a wide, toothless crevice. Its arms end in powerful fists and its legs end in humanoid feet. A crag man’s hands end in stony points that pierce an opponent’s skin with each slam. Once a day, a crag man can summon 2d10 piercers with a 50% chance of success. A crag man can employ *passwall* (as per the spell) once per day.

- Crag Man: **HD** 6: **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 2 piercing slams (1d8+2); **Move** 6; **Save** 11; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 7/600; **Special**: Pierce, piercer hellstorm, *passwall*

### Crayfish, Monstrous

Giant crayfish are freshwater creatures that dwell on the bottom of seas, lakes, ponds, and other shallow waters. They are predators and scavengers and exist on a diet of decaying flesh (dead fish and other water-based animals), algae, snails, worms, and other animals (including swimmers who come to close to their lair). Giant crayfish make their homes under rocks or in underwater tunnels burrowed out by the crayfish. Most underwater tunnels extend over long distances and include a “chimney” found along the edge of the water or even as far as 100 feet away from the water which allows the giant crayfish to enter and exit its passageways onto dry ground. A giant crayfish can survive out of the water for up to 7 hours before suffocating.

- Monstrous Crayfish: **HD** 4: **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d6); **Move** 9 (Swim 15); **Save** 13; **AL** N; **CL/XP**4/120; **Special**: Surprise on 1-2 on 1d6

### Crocodiles

#### Crocodile, Normal

Some normal crocodiles are man-eaters; all are dangerous and can conceal themselves well. Normal crocodiles can grow to be as long as 15 ft.

- Normal [Crocodile](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Crocodiles): **HD** 3; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d6); **Move** 9 (Swim 12); **Save** 14; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**: None.

#### Crocodile, Giant

The smallest of giant crocodiles are about 20ft long (normal crocodiles can grow to be as long as 15-ft).

- [Giant](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Giants) [Crocodile](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Crocodiles): **HD** 6; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 1 bite (3d6), 1 tail (1d6); **Move** 9 (Swim 12); **Save** 11; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 6/400; **Special**: None.

### Crucifixion Spirit

A crucifixion spirit is a translucent, gaunt humanoid with injuries to each wrist and to the arch of each foot. A crucifixion spirit makes no noise and its face is twisted in eternal pain. Its eyes flicker red. The incorporeal touch of a crucifixion spirit causes paralysis (save avoids). Five times per day, the spirit can point at a single target and crucify its soul if it hits its target. If the target fails a save, his body collapses as his soul is ripped out of his body and crucified to an X-shaped structure with translucent spikes. The victim is not dead, but loses 2 levels per round unless he is saved. A crucified victim can return to its body by making a save, but this leaves the victim stunned for one round.

- Crucifixion Spirit: **HD** 12: **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** Incorporeal touch (1d8 + paralysis) or crucify soul; **Move** 9 (Fly 18); **Save** 3; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 15/2900; **Special**: Crucify soul, paralysis

### Crumbler

Crumblers are mountain and cavern-dwelling “rock men,” who serve as guardians for important things. They are immune to fire, electricity and magical “blasting” attacks. Cutting weapons inflict half damage (and there is a 2 in 6 chance of non-magical weapons breaking against them). Hammers and maces do normal damage. They usually attack in groups, rising up out of the rubble surrounding boulder-laden areas. They cannot pursue, being rooted to the earth.

*(Author: Old Crawler).*

- [Crumbler](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Crumbler): **HD** 1; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 1 thrown rock (1d4) or fist (1d4); **Move** 0; **Save** 17; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**: Immunities.

### Crypt Thing

Crypt things are hooded and robed skeletons found sitting in high-backed chairs, its eyes appearing as small pinpoints of reddish light. They are created by spellcasters as tomb guardians. They never leave their assigned area and never initiate combat. A crypt thing is content to sit (or stand) in its assigned area so long as intruders do not disturb it or anything in the assigned area. At the first sign of disturbance however, a crypt thing springs to life. Its first order of business is to attempt to remove the interlopers from its assigned area by teleporting them 1d10 x 100 feet in a random direction (roll 1d4: 1, north; 2, south; 3, east; 4, west). The recipient of this free, unplanned trip can resist it with a saving throw. A teleported creature arrives in the closest open space at the determined destination. A teleported creature can arrive in mid-air rather than on a solid surface, if the crypt thing wishes.

#### Crypt Guardian

There exists in some parts of the world (and perhaps only truly in legend; sages aren’t sure) a variant of the crypt thing known as a crypt guardian. This variant has all the same abilities and powers as a normal crypt thing, with the following changes. The variant does not possess the ability to teleport others. Instead, it can simultaneously paralyze and turn invisible all creatures within 50 feet. An affected creature can make a saving throw to negate the effects. Affected creatures remain paralyzed and invisible for 2d4 days. A new save is allowed each day until the effects are broken, dispelled, or the duration ends.

#### Create Crypt Thing

**Spell Level**: Cleric and Magic-User, 7th Level **Range**: 60 feet **Duration**: Instantaneous

This spell allows you to animate a single corpse into a crypt thing. This spell must be cast in the area the creature is to guard or it fails. The corpse must be mostly intact and must be humanoid-shaped and have a skeletal system or structure. Only one crypt thing is created with this spell, and it remains in the area where it was created until destroyed. A black pearl gem worth at least 300 gp must be placed inside the mouth of the corpse. When the corpse animates, the gem is destroyed.

- Crypt Thing: **HD** 6: **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 11; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 9/1100; **Special**: Teleport other, +1 or better weapons to hit, turn as 10 HD monster

### Crystal Growth

A strange fungus grown from mineral deposits, the Crystal Growth appears to be a large, multi-faceted, crystalline lump. It may be mistaken for a massive piece of quartz, as it is usually the size of a human head. Crystal growth feeds upon minerals found in the bloodstream of humans, warm-blooded humanoids, and other intelligent mammals. Despite lacking any discernible sense organs, the crystal growth can somehow sense life within 90ft, and anyone touching the crystal growth will suffer an immediate attack. The crystal growth moves by rolling on its facets, and can bounce off walls, rock faces, and other hard objects to leap a few feet into the air. When it comes into contact with bare flesh, it drains blood at the rate of 1d8 hit points per round. Due to its partly mineral structure, it is heavy and can knock creatures off their feet by rolling and leaping at them. Some crystal growths learn the tactic of dropping from above onto the head and shoulders of targets. As the target may be knocked senseless by this tactic, the crystal growth is usually able to get in a few rounds of blood drain before being interrupted by other crystal growths seeking a free meal. A battle over food between crystal growths is a strange sight, with combatants rolling and battering against each other.

Reptilian and avian creatures lack the minerals the crystal growths feed upon, and crystal growths ignore them. Canny reptilians, such as subterranean lizards and cave-dwelling lizard men, have learned to crack open a crystal growth and lick out its salty, milk-like juices. The juice of one crystal growth is sufficient nourishment for one man-sized creature for half a day, or a full day if it contains blood. *(Author: Scott Wylie Roberts, "Myrystyr").*

- [Crystal Growth](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Crystal-Growth): **HD** 5; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 1 blood drain (1d8); **Move** 9; **Save** 12; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Blood drain.

### Crystaline

The crystalines resemble humanoids whose entire bodies are composed of crystal. When a crystalline dies (reaches 0 hp), its body shatters in an explosion of crystal shards. All within 10ft failing their save suffer 2d6 points of damage (a successful save halves the damage).

Crystalines have learned to use their faceted crystal-like bodies in conjunction with light to temporarily blind their foes. On a failed save the victim is considered blinded and suffers a -4 penalty to hit for the next 1d4 rounds. This ability counts as an action as the crystaline must position it body to capture the light and direct it effectively against a foe. *(Author: Skathros).*

- [Crystaline](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Crystaline): **HD** 3; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** Weapon ("fist") (1d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 14; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Blinding Refracted Light, Explosive Light.

### Crystalline Horror

A crystalline horror is a weird, unnatural humanoid made entirely of crystal and glass. It is man-sized and its head sports no eyes, nose, ears, or mouth. Its body appears razor-sharp and jagged. Its hands end in wicked claws. The origins of the crystalline horror are shrouded in mystery. A crystalline horror can loose a spray of razor-sharp shards of glass from its body in a 40-foot cone. A creature in the area takes 3d6 points of damage or half that amount if it succeeds on a saving throw. The crystalline horror can launch only five such sprays in a given day. Victims of any attack from the crystalline horror must pass an additional saving throw to avoid having an artery knicked. Unfortunates who fail such a saving throw suffer an additional 1d4 points of damage each round from bleeding until the wound is tended or magically healed. In place of attacking, a crystalline horror can refract natural light into a bright light that radiates out in a 10-foot spread. Creatures within this area must succeed on a saving throw or be blinded for 3 rounds.

- Crystalline Horror: **HD** 7: **AC** 0 \[19\]; **Atk** Shard spray (3d6) or claw (1d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 9; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 10/1400; **Special**: Shard spray, bend light, +1 or better weapons to hit, resistance to cold (50%)

### Crystallis

A crystallis is formed of quartz, earth, and crystal and stands about 13 feet tall. Its powerful arms and legs end in razor-sharp claws that glint and shine like polished steel. Its large rounded head sports two sunken crystalline eyes and a gaping toothless maw. A crystallis attacks with razor-sharp crystalline claws that cause opponents to bleed each round for 2 hit points of damage until a healing spell is cast on the creature. Once every 1d4+1 rounds, the creature can breathe a cloud of orange smoke that fills a 10-foot cube in front of the crystallis. Anyone inside this smoke must save or be turned into a crystal, gem-encrusted statue.

- Crystallis: **HD** 14: **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 2 claws (2d6+3); **Move** 6 (Burrow 6); **Save** 3; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 17/3500; **Special**: Crystalline claws, wounding, petrification breath

### Daemons

Demons are creatures of the lower planes of existence, but they are occasionally encountered in places where they have been enslaved to serve as guardians by powerful magic-users or evil priests. The more intelligent varieties might also be interrupted while carrying out plots of their own. *Swords & Wizardry* makes no game distinction between demons and daemons, for the convenience of those using only a three-alignment system; all are simply creatures of the lower planes, to be used as desired with the Referee’s own campaign.

#### Daemon, Cacodaemon

Cacodaemons are tall, sleek, ebony humanoids with long, thick arms that end in powerful claws. The average cacodaemon stands about 7 feet tall and weighs about 800 pounds. They have sleek, hairless heads and bright, fiery red eyes. Their mouths are lined with sharpened teeth and fangs. They are employed as guards and soldiers in the Oinodaemon’s palace. Cacodaemons are completely loyal to the Oinodaemon and never question their position or authority; they do not take orders from any other daemon. Cacodaemons are relentless combatants and never back down from a fight. They often begin combat by changing forms and appearing as a race friendly to their potential opponents. Once an opponent is lured close to the cacodaemon, it changes to its natural form and attacks. Cacodaemons can cast the following spells: *darkness, esp, fear* and *hold person* (3/day).

- Cacodaemon: **HD** 12; **AC** -3 \[22\]; **Atk** Sword (2d6) or 2 claws (1d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 3; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 18/3800; **Special**: Spells, only harmed by silver weapons, immunity to acid and poison, magic resistance (60%), telepathy 100 ft.

#### Daemon, Charon (Boatman of the Lower Planes)

Charon spends his time ferrying dead souls to their final resting place in the Lower Planes. He appears as a skeleton shrouded in a dark hooded robe with small pinpoints of crimson light burning in his empty eye sockets. He uses a large, flat skiff to ferry his passengers across the dangerous waters of the River Styx. On occasion, he ferries living souls to a desired location within the Lower Planes, though he charges a hefty price for such passage. A rare and costly (to one’s sanity) spell can be used to summon the dread boatman. Passage for living souls across the River Styx costs a single magic item, 500 pp, or two gems of at least 1,000 gp total value. If his price is refused, Charon turns his skiff and moves away. If attacked, Charon attacks but seeks to escape as soon as possible. Those within 30 feet meeting Charon’s gaze must succeed on a saving throw or be paralyzed with fear for a number of rounds equal to the value by which they failed their saving throw. A creature hit by Charon’s staff must succeed on a saving throw or be paralyzed for 2d6 minutes. Charon can see through invisibility. Once per day he can trace a s*ymbol of fear* or *symbol of stunning*. Three times per day, Charon can summon 2d4 charonadaemons. Charon can control the waters of the River Styx as if using the *control water* spell. Additionally, he can form a 16 HD water elemental using this ability. A Styx elemental uses the standard 16 HD water elemental statistics with the addition that its touch causes *feeblemind* in those who fail a saving throw. Charon can roam the planes in its skiff at will.

- Charon: **HD** 32 (128 hp); **AC** -5 \[24\]; **Atk** Staff (2d6); **Move** 18; **Save** 3; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 40/10800; **Special**: Control Styx, fear gaze, paralysis, spells, +1 or better weapons to hit, immunity to acid and poison, magic resistance (90%), telepathy 100 ft.

#### Daemon, Charonodaemon

Charonadaemons resemble their master, Charon, the Boatman of the Lower Planes, and are often mistaken for him. Unlike their master, they care nothing for ferrying souls across the River Styx and merely seek to murder or steal from those that request passage. Travel across the River Styx by a charonadaemon costs a single magic item, 50 pp, or 2 gems (total value of both gems must be at least 100 gp). Even if the price is paid, the charonadaemon usually betrays his passengers, attempting to dump them into the River Styx or kill them outright. If more money or fare is offered, the charonadaemon might be persuaded not to attack. A charonadaemon can be summoned to the banks of the River Styx by casting *symbol* (any). Those within 30 feet meeting the gaze of a charonadaemon must succeed on a saving throw or be paralyzed with fear for a number of rounds equal to the value by which they failed their saving throw. Charonadaemons can cast, at will, the spells *cause fear* and *darkness*, and they can discern invisible creatures. Charonadaemons can roam the planes in their skiffs at will.

- Charonodaemon: **HD** 10**;** **AC** -2 \[21\]; **Atk** Staff (1d8); **Move** 15; **Save** 5; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 15/2900; **Special**: Fear gaze, spells, only harmed by silver weapons, immunity to acid and poison, magic resistance (45%), telepathy 100 ft.

#### Daemon, Dhergodaemon

The derghodaemon is one of the strongest of the daemon races, but its low intelligence has relegated it to a position of brute warrior and little more. It is a tall, bloated, insect-like creature with five arms and three legs. Each of its arms ends in a sharpened, clawed hand. Its legs end in four-toed feet. Its flesh is mottled green and black and its eyes are large and black with no pupils. A derghodaemon stands 8 feet tall and weighs about 800 pounds. Twice per day, by clicking its mandibles, a derghodaemon can affect all creatures within 30 feet as if by a *feeblemind* spell. A derghodaemon’s head can rotate 360 degrees, making it almost impossible to surprise the creatures or back stab them. In addition, they can see invisible creatures. Derghodaemons can cast, at will, the spells *cause* *fear*, *darkness* and *sleep*.

- Dhergoodaemon: **HD** 10**;** **AC** -2 \[21\]; **Atk** 5 claws (1d4) or 2 claws (1d4) and 3 swords (2d6); **Move** 15; **Save** 5; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 15/2900; **Special**: Feeblemind, spells, only harmed by silver weapons, immunity to acid and poison, magic resistance (50%), telepathy 100 ft.

#### Daemon, Guardian

A guardian daemon is summoned to the Material Plane by a spellcaster with the task of guarding an area or treasure. These daemons vary in size and appearance, though most resemble large bears, wild cats, or apes with added daemonic characteristics (horns, elongated fangs and nails, and so on). Despite its varying appearance and form, the guardian daemon is a dangerous adversary. Most guardian daemons are of neutral slant, though many, due to their daemonic heritage, are chaotic and usually only serve those of like alignment.

A guardian daemon only initiates combat if the area it is guarding is entered or the treasure it is watching over is disturbed. The realm of a guardian daemon encompasses only the area it is summoned to guard; a room, chamber, or treasure. The guardian daemon can wander freely in its area, but cannot move beyond the precincts of the designated area.

Three times per day a guardian daemon can breathe a cone of fire 30 feet long with a 15-foot wide base. This cone of fire deals 5d6 points of damage (save for half damage).

Guardian daemons are immune to mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects), *sleep, hold,* and *polymorph*. They cannot be harmed by acid and poison.

- Guardian Daemon: **HD** 8**;** **AC** -1 \[20\]; **Atk** Bite (2d6), 2 claws (1d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 8; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 11/1700; **Special**: Breath weapon, +1 or better weapon to hit, immunity to acid and poison, limited domain, telepathy 100 ft.

#### Daemon, Hydrodaemon

Hydrodaemons are frog-like daemons that swim the River Styx. They are the only known creatures in existence that can touch the waters of the Styx without suffering any ill effects. Hydrodaemons are 10 feet tall and weight about 4,000 pounds. Large flaps of skin under their arms allow them to glide when leaping. The flesh of a hydrodaemon is warty and green. Its eyes are a sickly yellow in color. Up to five times per day a hydrodaemon can expel a 20-foot long line of sputum that causes those hit to save vs. sleep (as the spell) for 6 rounds. Hydrodaemons can, at will, cast *cause fear, darkness, detect magic* and *dimenson door*. Once per day, they can summon an 8 HD water elemental.

- Hydrodaemon: **HD** 7**;** **AC** 0 \[19\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d6), bite (2d6) or spit (see below); **Move** 9/24/12 (swimming/flying); **Save** 9; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 13/2300; **Special**: Spittle, spells, only hamed by silver weapons, immunity to acid and poison, magic resistance (35%), telepathy 100 ft.

#### Daemon, The Oinodaemon

The Oinodaemon claims rulership over all other daemons. There is no other single figure in the lower planes that commands more respect (and fear) than the Oinodaemon (excepting a few powerful arch devils). His position is constantly threatened by those that would usurp the throne and take the position for themselves. There are believed to be at least seven other extremely powerful daemons vying for the throne and title. Through subtle machinations, sheer power, and fear, the Oinodaemon has staved them off thus far.

The Oinodaemon stands 9 feet tall. Its head resembles that of a diseased and rotting ram with downward, forward-curving horns. The wool and flesh of its humanoid body seem to pull away or drop away in sickly clumps. Its body is covered in boils, blisters, sores and scabs. Thick, white foam oozes from its mouth and a thin yellow ichor squeezes from its bloodshot eyes.

The touch of the Oinodaemon carries with its the daemon plague, a terrible disease that prevents magical and natural healing and rots the flesh while the victim yet lives. A person afflicted with the daemon plague is contagious until it dies, usually in one week.

Oinodaemon’s gaze transfixes one target per round unless a saving throw is made. The transfixed target cannot move until permitted to do so.

Oinodaemon can cast spells as a 12th level cleric, as well as *detect magic, dispel magic* and *invisibility* at will and *feeblemind* once per day. Once per day, his touch can act as a *rod of cancellation.*

***Staff of the Lower Planes:*** This 12-foot long, black wooden staff can only be wielded by the current Oinodaemon or any daemon he allows to wield it. In anyone else’s hands, the staff functions as a normal quarterstaff. Upon the current Oinodaemon’s death, the staff can be wielded (and it functions as detailed below) by the new Oinodaemon. The staff has the power of a staff of withering and can cast a charm monster spell that affects up to 20 targets, can lay a geas upon a person and can grant another’s wish.

#### Servants of the Oinodaemon

Followers of the Oinodaemon are usually evil humanoids and often consist of clerics and necromancers. Clerics of the Oinodaemon are called Servants of Decay and must sign a pact of evil with the Oinodaemon. Servants of Decay can receive cleric spells up to 3rd level from the Oinodaemon.

- The Oinodaemon: **HD** 25 (100 hp); **AC** -3 \[22\]; **Atk** 2 slams (2d6 plus disease); **Move** 15; **Save** 3; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 34/8600; **Special**: Spittle, spells, only hamed by silver weapons, immunity to acid and poison, magic resistance (35%), telepathy 100 ft.

#### Daemon, Piscodaemon

Piscodaemons look like 7-foot tall bipedal lobsters with long, gangly arms that end in powerful pincers. It has a short, fish-like tail on its posterior and a centipede-like head with several small tentacles located beneath its mouth and looking like a writhing beard. Piscodaemons are found throughout the Lower Planes bullying and killing weaker creatures. They are often themselves used as cannon fodder or slaves by the more powerful races of the Lower Planes. If a piscodaemon scores a natural 20 on its attack roll with a claw attack and its victim fails a saving throw, it severs one of the opponent’s extremities (roll 1d6: 1-3 arm, 4-6 leg; 50% chance of either right or left). A piscodaemon’s mouth tentacles are poisonous, affecting a victim as though with a slow spell for 1 minute if a saving throw is failed. Piscodaemons can cast the following spells: *Blink, cause fear, darkness, stinking cloud and mirror image* (2/day). The piscodaemon’s faceted eyes can see in all directions, making it difficult to surprise. In addition, they can see invisible creatures and objects.

- Piscodaemon: **HD** 10**;** **AC** -1 \[20\]; **Atk** 2 claws (2d6), mouth tentacles (1d8 plus poison); **Move** 9/18 (swimming); **Save** 5; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 20/4400; **Special**: Constrict, poison, spells, vorpal strike, only harmed by silver weapons, immunity to acid and poison, magic resistance (50%), telepathy 100 ft.

### Dakon

Dakons are a race of intelligent apes that make their homes in the warmer regions of the world, though rarely, if ever, near a large expanse of water as they simply don’t trust the stuff. They are generally friendly toward humans who share their alignment, and view all other races (even those races of the same alignment as the dakons) with caution and suspicion. Dakons stand 8 feet tall and weigh about 500 pounds. Dakons speak their own language and might speak Common if they dwell near humans. Dakons are very passive and docile creatures; they rarely attack except in self-defense. If forced into combat, a dakon attacks with its claws.

- Dakon: **HD** 2; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d6); **Move** 12/12 (climbing); **Save** 16; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 2/30; **Special**: None

### Darakel

The Darakel is a gigantic horse-headed eel, forty feet long and highly aggressive. It can attack with a nasty fanged bite and tail slap, and three times per day may exhale a 20-foot radius cloud of poison from its nostrils (5d6 points of damage in addition to normal attacks, saving throw for half damage). The Darakel can slither about on land at its normal movement rate, and enjoys preying upon farmers and livestock. It is immune to poison. *(Author: Scott Wylie Roberts, "Myrystyr").*

- Darakel: **HD** 10; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 1 bite (3d6), 1 tail (2d6); **Move** 12 (swim 12); **Save** 5; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 11/1700; **Special**: Poison breath (3/day).

### Dark Creeper

Dark creepers are humanoids that stand just under 4 feet tall, always swathed in heavy, dark cloaks and wrappings. Their flesh is pale and moist, and their eyes are milky white. Dark creepers exude a foul stench of sweat and spoiled food, owing primarily to the fact that they never take off their clothing—instead piling on new layers when the outermost one grows too ragged.

Dark creepers lurk in the black places deep below the surface of the world, venturing forth at night or into neighboring societies when the urge to steal and cause mayhem grows too great to resist. Endless layers of filthy, moldering black cloth shroud these small creatures, leading some to believe that the creature inside is smaller still. Usually encountered in groups, dark creepers flee from bright light, but are quite brave in the dark.

For all the mayhem and trouble a pack of dark creepers can cause, this is nothing compared to the dangers a tribe led by the taller, even more sinister dark stalkers represents. Dark creepers treat their tall, lithe masters almost like gods, presenting them with offerings and obeying their every whim. Invariably, several dark stalkers serve as leaders to dark creeper tribes, with all of the tribe’s heavy work and labor falling on the diminutive shoulders of the creepers, freeing the dark stalkers for their own decadent pleasures. Yet the dark creepers themselves see no inherent imbalance in this arrangement—to a dark creeper, a life in the servitude of a dark stalker is a life fulfilled.

Dark creepers use daggers in combat, coating them with the poison called black smear. Black smear poison (unless a saving throw is made) reduces the victim’s strength by 1d2 points per round for 2d6-1 rounds. If the victim’s strength is reduced to 0, the victim dies. If the victim survives, the points of strength will return in 1d6 hours. The poison on a blade is used up when the weapon hits.

Dark creepers (and dark stalkers) are able to employ magic to create a very deep darkness, much more potent than ordinary darkness/light spells. This deeper darkness has a radius of 50ft, and several effects: (1) all normal light sources in the radius of effect are not only extinguished, but cannot be relit for a period of one hour; (2) all magical light sources must make a saving throw or be extinguished for a period of one hour; (3) darkvision will not penetrate the 50ft radius area around the object upon which the deeper darkness has been cast. Magical light sources that are not extinguished by the spell are able to function within the deeper darkness, but convey a range of vision no greater than 30ft.

When a dark creeper is slain, its body combusts in a flash of bright white light, leaving its gear in a heap on the ground. All creatures within a 10-foot burst must make a saving throw or be blinded for 1d6 rounds. Other dark creepers within 10 feet are automatically blinded for at least 1 round.

- Dark Creeper: **HD** 1+1; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 1 dagger (1d4 + special poison); **Move** 9; **Save** 17; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**: create special darkness, death-flash, level 4 thief.

### Dark Stalker

The strange and mysterious dark stalkers are apparently a noble sub-race of the dark creepers. The stalkers dwell in strange villages (some rumors suggest entire cities) built of stone and fungus, in remote underground caverns where they are served and worshiped by their coarser, diminutive kin, the dark creepers. Dark stalkers come to the surface rarely, but when they do it is on a mission, and with a force of creatures such that it never ends well for those they seek to rob or torment. Dark stalkers are tall, frail humanoids with incredibly pale skin. They always wear multiple layers of dark cloth and black leather armor, yet unlike their lesser kin, a dark stalker’s garb is always clean and spotless. Each dark stalker carries a pair of short swords— they prefer these weapons to all others, and coat them with the poison called black smear. Black smear poison (unless a saving throw is made) reduces the victim’s strength by 1d2 points per round for 2d6-1 rounds. If the victim’s strength is reduced to 0, the victim dies. If the victim survives, the points of strength will return in 1d6 hours. The poison on a blade is used up when the weapon hits.

Dark stalkers are 6 feet tall and weigh 100 pounds.

Dark stalkers have the ability to create a very powerful form of *darkness* magic 3 times per day (see dark creeper). All dark stalkers have the abilities of a level 4 thief. When a dark stalker is killed, its body explodes in a flash of illumination that causes 3d6 points of damage to anyone within 40ft (save for half damage).

In a fight, dark stalkers are not above sacrificing lesser creatures, including dark creepers, to win the day or cover their retreat if things go poorly. They hate well-lit areas and always prefer to fight under the cover of magical darkness. Dark stalkers rarely fight to the death if it can be avoided, preferring to slip away if things begin to look grim. The origins of the dark stalkers and the dark creepers are shrouded in mystery, made more difficult to decipher by the fact that the dark stalkers do not keep records of their history. Many scholars believe that, just as the drow descended from elves, so too must the dark folk have descended from humanity, their eerie powers and spell-like abilities the result of generation upon generation of devotion to profane and sinister magic.

- Darkmantle: **HD** 6+2; **AC** 7 \[12\] or 0 \[19\] in darkness; **Atk** 1 short sword (1d6 + special poison); **Move** 12; **Save** 11; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: Create special darkness, death-flash, level 4 thief.

### Darkmantle

Darkmantles are flying, octopus-like creatures with skin textured and colored to resemble limestone. They ambush prey by sticking to cavern ceilings, and dropping to the attack (they are clumsy fliers). If a darkmantle hits, it attempts to suffocate its prey by folding its tentacles (and the webbing between the tentacles) around the victim’s head. If a darkmantle misses its attack, it will flap heavily into the air to make another attempt. When a darkmantle hits, the victim makes a saving throw to avoid having his head enfolded in the darkmantle’s octopoid clutches. If the saving throw succeeds, no damage is inflicted. If the saving throw fails, the darkmantle has attached and inflicts 1d4 points of damage, continuing to constrict for an automatic 1d4 points each round thereafter. Darkmantles have the ability to create darkness in a radius of 15-ft.

- Darkmantle: **HD** 1+2; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 1 grab (1d4); **Move** 3 (Fly 3); **Save** 17; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 2/30; **Special**: Suffocation, darkness.

### Darnoc

The darnoc is a corrupting evil presence whose very touch sucks the life from an opponent bit by painful bit. The darnoc are said to be the restless spirits of oppressive, cruel, and power hungry individuals cursed forever to a life of monotony and toil, forbidden by the gods to taste the spoils of the afterlife they so desperately craved in life. Often seen in the clothes and guise it wore in life, a darnoc often walks the same halls and repeats the same actions of its insipid existence over and over again.

Due to their great greed, a darnoc may be found within its treasury endlessly counting its coins, or within a graveyard noting the headstones of its vanquished foes with cruel mirth. When distracted from its reverie of its remembered past life, the creature flies into an inconsolable rage, often lashing out without warning or provocation at the first individual who attempts to speak to it. Creatures within a 30-foot radius and with less HD than the darnoc become flee in dear for 2d6 rounds when it flies into a rage if they fail a saving throw.

Once per day, a darnoc can scribe a symbol in the air. All creatures with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher within 60 feet who see the symbol must succeed on a saving throw or immediately fall into loud bickering and arguing. Meaningful communication is impossible. If the affected creatures have different alignments, there is a 50% chance that they attack each other. Bickering lasts 3d6 rounds. Fighting begins 1d6 rounds into the bickering and lasts 2d6 rounds. Once triggered, the symbol lasts 2 hours. Any damage dealt by a darnoc’s slam attack does not heal naturally and resists all magical healing (potions, *cure* spells, and so on). Before the damage can be healed, the curse must first be broken with a *break* *enchantment* or *remove curse* spell (requiring a DC 20 caster level check for either spell).

A darnoc can become incorporeal for up to 10 minutes each day. While incorporeal, the darnoc can only be harmed by magic weapons and spells. Any humanoid slain by a darnoc becomes a darnoc in 1d4 rounds. Spawn are under the command of the darnoc that created them and remain enslaved until its destruction.

- Darnoc: **HD** 8; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** slam (1d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 8; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 10/1400; **Special**: Curse of the grave, symbol of discord, ghostly

### Deasic (Ice Creeper)

The Deasic, or Ice Creeper, is a creature of living ice, resembling a long, branching, crystal-like structure. The deasic attacks by stealth, creeping up to living creatures in their sleep, smothering their air passages and draining their life heat. Anyone slain in this manner becomes frozen solid, as the warmth of life is sucked out of them. If discovered before it can complete its attack, the deasic will defend itself with dagger-like shafts of ice. It is immune to fire and cold based attacks, and can cause a burst of icy shards to erupt from its body, three times per day, causing 6d6 damage to all within 20ft. Deasic apparently have a rudimentary intelligence and society, as they have occasionally been observed gathering in large numbers to form gigantic snowflake-shaped structures under the aurora of polar skies in winter. *(Author: Scott Wylie Roberts, "Myrystyr").*

- Deasic (Ice Creeper): **HD** 9; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 1 smother (2d6) or 3 ice daggers (1d4); **Move** 6; **Save** 6; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 11/1700; **Special**: Smothers, explosion of shards, immunities.

### Death Dog

Death dogs are two-headed, mastiff-like hounds; nocturnal killing machines that hunt their prey without hesitation across the desert sands and wastelands. Death dog packs have been known to share territory with little friction, although they do engage in dominance battles in leaner times when hunting is difficult. Victims of the death dog’s bite must pass a saving throw or come down with the rotting death, losing 1d6 points of constitution each day until they succeed at a saving throw at a -5 penalty. Victims who lose all their points of constitution die. Constitution can be restored with powerful healing magic or be complete bed rest, with one point of constitution returning with each week of rest.

- Death Dog: **HD** 2; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 2 bites (1d6 plus rotting death); **Move** 15; **Save** 16; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 10/1400; **Special**: Rotting death

### Death Worm

Death worms are long, slender, reddish-brown monsters related to the purple worm. Its skin is mottled yellow across its back, tapering off as the colors near its head. Its mouth is huge and lined with rock hard teeth that allow it to break rocks and earth as it burrows underground. The death worm is a reclusive, desert-dwelling creature content to spend its life burrowing beneath the ground and sustaining itself on a diet of sand and earth. On occasion, it surfaces to devour more substantial prey (animals such as saiga, deer, yaks and humans). Death worms lay their eggs far beneath the surface of the earth. A death worm lurks under sand or loose earth, waiting for its prey to move close where it then ambushes its target, surprising on a 1-3 on 1d6. A death worm’s mouth constantly drips highly corrosive saliva. Once every 1d4 rounds a death worm can spit a 3 dice lightning bolt (saving throw for half damage).

- Death Worm: **HD** 7; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** Bite (1d8 plus 1d6 acid); **Move** 9/6 (burrowing); **Save** 9; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: Spit lightning, surprise on 1-3 on 1d6

### Decapus

A decapus is a large (4-foot in diameter), pale green spheroid with ten octopus-like tentacles protruding from its body. Hair grows in broken patches along its body. Its eyes are stark white and pupiless. Its large mouth sports long, yellow fangs. Decapuses are solitary creatures that dwell in dense forests or underground. Most prefer the forests as their ability to move among the trees allows them to either pursue their prey or flee in situations not to their advantage. On the ground, decapuses are slow-moving, thus they spend most of their time among the tree tops. Decapuses are nocturnal hunters and are quite fond of human, elf, and halfling flesh. In times when food is scarce, they exist on a diet of rats, snakes, and other small forest creatures (or dungeon denizens in the case of the subterranean decapus). Decapuses seem to be able to speak with others of their kind using a series of guttural noises.

Decapuses attack with their tentacles. A decapus that beats its opponent’s Armor Class by 6 or more latches around their neck and scores automatic damage each round thereafter until it is killed (and 1d4 rounds even after it is killed) or its victim makes a successful open doors check. At will, a decapus can create an effect identical to the phantasmal force spell. The creature can also mimic any creature it has previously encountered with near total accuracy, though it cannot mimic humanoid speech longer than two or three words at a time.

- Decapus: **HD** 4; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 9 tentacles (1d4); **Move** 6/12 (climbing and swinging); **Save** 13; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 7/600; **Special**: Strangle, illusion

### Demi-Lich

A demilich is a skull with gems in place of its eyes and teeth. Demiliches cannot be turned, and can cast cast *death* spells at will. Up to 8 times a day, a demilich can steal the soul of any creature within 30 feet unless the victim makes a save. After 24 hours, the demilich devours the soul, permanently slaying the creature. *Power word kill* and *dispel evil* spells deal 50 points of damage (no save) to a demilich. Demiliches are immune to all other spells. Unless its remains are consecrated, a demilich reforms in 1d10 days.

- Demi-Lich: **HD** 11; **AC** 0 \[19\]; **Atk** Steal soul; **Move** 12 (flying); **Save** 4; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 13/2300; **Special**: Immune to most spells, +3 or better magic weapon to hit, immune to acid, electricity, fire, cold and polymorph, rejuvenation, steal souls

### Demiurge

The demiurge is the undead spirit of an evil human returned from the grave with a wrathful vengeance against all living creatures that enter its domain. The demiurge is very territorial, usually haunting an area of up to three square miles from its place of death. It appears as a humanoid with sunken nose, hollow eye sockets, and sickly pale white, semi-transparent flesh. Its hair is unkempt and dirty, and its clothes are nothing more than rags that hang loosely from its translucent form. Any creature within 30 feet meeting the demiurge’s gaze must succeed on a saving throw or be transfixed for one turn as if affected by a hold person spell. The touch of the demiurge brings the cold of the grave and deals 1d4 points of damage to a living creature touched. A creature that is moved through by a demiurge must pass a saving throw or die from shock. Animals can sense the unnatural presence of a demiurge at a distance of 30 feet. They will not willingly approach nearer than that and panic if forced to do so; they remain panicked as long as they are within that range.

- Demiurge: **HD** 8; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** Incorporeal touch (1d4); **Move** 12/15 (flying); **Save** 8; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 14/2600; **Special**: Chill, soul touch, transfixing gaze, incorporeal, only harmed by cold-wrought iron or spells, magic resistance (50%)

### Demodands

Demons are creatures of the lower planes of existence, but they are occasionally encountered in places where they have been enslaved to serve as guardians by powerful magic-users or evil priests. The more intelligent varieties might also be interrupted while carrying out plots of their own. *Swords & Wizardry* makes no game distinction between demons and demodands, for the convenience of those using only a three-alignment system; all are simply creatures of the lower planes, to be used as desired with the Referee’s own campaign.

#### Demodand, Shaggy

The mighty shaggy demodands are the ruling class of the demodand race. No greater demodands are known to exist, though rumors lately hint at a single, powerful demodand of near-deity status. Shaggy demodands are by far the most malign, selfish, evil, and ruthless of the tripartite race of demodands. They are the nobility and upper class of demodand society and commanders of the demodand armies. A typical shaggy demodand stands 6 feet tall and weighs about 550 pounds. They resemble bipedal frog-like creatures with crimson skin. Shaggy demodands are bloated and their skin hangs in great folds about its body. Large, bat-like wings protrude from the creature’s shoulders. Shaggy demodands can cast the following spells: *Charm monster* (1/day), *cloudkill* (3/day), *dispel magic* (1/day), *ESP, gaseous form, invisibility (self),* and *obscuring mist* (3/day).

- Demodand, Shaggy **HD** 15; **AC** -3 \[22\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d8), and bite (2d6); **Move** 15/18 (flying); **Save** 3; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 22/5000; **Special**: Spells, +1 or better weapon to hit, magic resistance (75%), immunity to acid and poison, immune to mental effects

#### Demodand, Slime

Slime demodnads are 6 to 7-foot tall, bloated, slimy, black humanoids with large bat-like wings protruding from their shoulders. Its skin constantly drips and oozes a thick white-gray mucus. It has thick elephantine legs and long, powerful arms that end in razor-sharp talons. Slime demodands delight in torturing creatures of lesser skill and rank than themselves. The slimy secretions of the slime demodand are highly acidic, thus any contact with its skin causes 1d6 points of damage. Creatures hit by all three of the demodand’s attacks in a round are covered in the acidic slime and suffer 1d6 points of damage per round until they are doused in either sand or alcohol. Wine cuts the damage in half and water has no effect. Slime demodands exude a stench to a range of 30 feet. Any living creature in the area must succeed on a saving throw or become sickened, suffering a -2 penalty to hit and save each round they are in the area and 2d6 rounds after leaving the area. Slime demodands can cast the following spells: *Cause fear, dispel magic* (1/day), *ESP,* *gaseous form, invisibility (self)* and *obscuring mist*.

- Demodand, Slime **HD** 13; **AC** -2 \[21\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d8 plus 1d6 acid) and bite (1d8); **Move** 15/18 (flying); **Save** 3; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 22/5000; **Special**: Enslime, spells, +1 or better weapon to hit, immunity to acid and poison, immune to mental effects, magic

#### Demodand, Tarry

Tarry demodands are tall gray-skinned humanoids with green eyes and a long, oval heads. Two large, dull gray bat-like wings sprout from its shoulders. Its hands end in blackened claws. Cruel, malevolent creatures, they wander the planes of Tarterus as soldiers and warriors in the mighty demodand armies. Tarry demodands care little for anything and attack and kill just about anything weaker than themselves. When they take damage, they have a 50% chance of flying into a rage, gaining +2 bonus to hit and damage and suffering a -2 penalty to Armor Class. A tarry demodand exudes a thick tar-like substance that acts as a powerful adhesive, holding fast any creatures or items touching it. Removing a stuck item or body part requires an open door check. Because of their adhesive skin, tarry demodands enjoy a +2 bonus to grapple and pin opponents in combat. Strong alcohol dissolves the adhesive. A pint of wine or a similar liquid weakens it, but the tarry demodand can still grapple normally. A tarry demodand can dissolve its adhesive at will, and the substance breaks down 1 minute after the creature dies. Tarry demodands can cast the following spells: *Cause fear, dispel magic* (1/day), *ESP,* *gaseous form, invisibility (self)* and *obscuring mist*.

- Demodand, Tarry **HD** 11; **AC** -1 \[20\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d8), bite (1d8); **Move** 15/18 (flying); **Save** 4; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 18/3800; **Special**: Adhesive, spells, +1 or better weapon to hit, immune to acid and poison, immune to mental effects, magic resistance (50%)

### Demons

Demons are creatures of the lower planes of existence, but they are occasionally encountered in places where they have been enslaved to serve as guardians by powerful magic-users or evil priests. The more intelligent varieties might also be interrupted while carrying out plots of their own. *Swords & Wizardry* makes no game distinction between demons and devils, for the convenience of those using only a three-alignment system; all are simply creatures of the lower planes, to be used as desired with the Referee’s own campaign.

#### Demon, Achaierai

Achaierai resemble hellish birds standing fifteen feet tall on four stilt-like legs with cruel talons. Three times per day an achaierai can breathe a black cloud of gas, inflicting 1d6 points of damage and requiring a saving throw to prevent being affected as if by a Confusion spell. As demons, they are immune to fire.

- Achaierai Demon: **HD** 6; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d6), 1 bite (2d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 11; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 9/1100; **Special**: Magic resistance (25%), breath of confusion, immune to fire.

#### Demon, Aeshma (Rage Demon)

Aeshma are demons of rage. They creature are 8-foot tall humanoids with basalt-colored skin. Dark hair covers its head and its hair is long and braided. Its arms are well-muscled and its hands end in powerful claws. Its head is human-like and its eyes are sapphire blue. Large leathery, bat-like wings protrude from its shoulders. Aeshma, sometimes called “fiends of the wounding spear”, sometimes command battalions of lesser demons, usually vrocks or dretches. An aeshma that is reduced to half it normal hit points in combat flies into a berserk rage on its next turn, swinging madly with its longspear. A raging aeshma fights until either it or its opponent is dead and gains an additional attack each round. Aeshma continuously see invisibility. They can cast a web spell twice per day. Aeshma carry long *+1 spears* that cause terrible wounds when they hit. Creatures wounded by these spears suffer 1d2 points of damage each round after they are wounded from blood loss until the wounds are bound or magically healed.

- Aeshma (Rage Demon): **HD** 12; **AC** -1 \[20\]; **Atk** Weapon (2d6+1) or 2 claws (1d8); **Move** 15/21 (flying); **Save** 3; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 19/4100; **Special**: Rage, spells, wounding spear, +1 or better weapon to hit, immune to electricity, see invisibility, magic resistance (45%), telepathy 100 ft.

#### Demon, Alu-

The alu-demon is the female demonic offspring of a succubus and human. Though part demon, not all alu-demons are inherently chaotic (although lawful alu-demons are extremely rare). The typical alu-demon has black or brown hair and dark green, brown, or black eyes. Alu-demons might be sent to the Material Plane to seduce mortals. When on such missions they typically arrange their flowing hair so it hides their horns and also fold their wings against their backs (and tuck them under their robe, shirt, or whatever garment of clothing one happens to be wearing at the time). Each time an alu-demon hits with its claw attack it gains temporary hit points equal to the damage she inflicts. These temporary hit points disappear in one hour. Alu-demons can cast the following spells: *Charm person* (3/day), *dimension door* (1/day), *ESP* (3/day) and *suggestion* (1/day).

- Alu-Demon: **HD** 6; **AC** 1 \[18\]; **Atk** Sword (1d8) or 2 claws (1d4); **Move** 12/18 (flying); **Save** 11; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 10/1400; **Special**: Spells, vampiric touch, immune to poison, magic resistance (15%), telepathy 100 ft.

#### Demon, Arauk (First-category Demon)

Arauks are a somewhat lesser-known first-category demon, unrelated to the Vrock type but roughly equal in strength to the other type. Arauk demons have heads resembling that of a horsefly and legs like a goat’s; the demon’s hair-covered torso is human, but with four arms. They have bat-like wings, but they are slow and clumsy fliers.

Arauks take only half damage from electricity, cold, fire, and poison gas. They are able to cast *darkness* in a radius of 5-ft. at will, and to *teleport* once per day. In addition, they have the ability to *detect invisibility*, cause *fear* (as per a wand), and to *telekinese* 100 pounds of weight, each usable at will. In addition to the weapons they carry, Arauk demons can breathe a small cloud of fire (10 ft. in diameter) in addition to their normal attacks, causing 1d6 hit points of damage unless the target(s) make a saving throw against the breath weapon.

Arauk demons can be hit by normal weapons. They can *gate* in another Arauk (10% chance of success). *(Author: Matt Finch)*

- Arauk Demon: **HD** 8; **AC** 0 \[19\]; **Atk** 4 weapons (by weapon); **Move** 12 (Fly 12); **Save** 8; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 11/1700; **Special**: Demonic immunities, magical abilities, breathe fire, gate (10%).

#### Demon, Baalroch (Balor) (Sixth-category Demon)

Editor's Note

The Baalroch seems to be missing a stat block for its special spell-like abilities?

Hmm. I have a feeling we might have used the "Balrog" stats from the very early printing of the game for the type 6, which would then be overshadowed somewhat by the Eldritch Wizardry demons. Try adding *fear*, *detect magic*, *read magic*, *read languages*, *detect invisibility*, *dispel magic*, *pyrotechnics*, *suggestion*, *telekinesis* (600 lbs.), *symbol of fear*, *discord*, *sleep*, *stunning*.

That's more on par with the others. **\- Matt F.**

\[[Source](https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/117966648995453744773)\]

The Baalroch’s name means, roughly, the Bull of Baal: the Baal-aurochs (the aurochs was a bull that stood twelve feet tall at the shoulder, and Baal is an ancient and evil pagan deity). These powerful demons somewhat resemble vast minotaurs with great, spreading bat-wings; they burn with the fires of hell and are wreathed in flame. Spells from casters below 6<sup>th</sup> level do not affect them, and against higher-level spell casters they are yet 75% immune to all spells. In combat, a baalroch uses whip and sword; the whip can be used to reach great distances – on a successful hit the victim is pulled close to the baalroch and burned by the fires of the demon’s body (3d6 hit points). Baalrochs are sometimes referred to in ancient texts as Balor or Baalor, which may be the name of a single demon rather than a term for all of them. A baalroch could be forced or tricked into the service of a powerful wizard, but the risk would be immense.

Baalrochs may attempt to gate in an ally with a 70% chance of success. The responding demon will usually be a third-category demon (01-80 on 1d100) but an unusually successful summoning might call a fourth-category demon (81-00 on 1d100).

- Baalroch Demon: **HD** 10; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 1 sword (1d12+2) and 1 whip (entangles); **Move** 6 (Fly 15); **Save** 5; **CL/XP** 17/3500; **Special**: Magic Resistance (75%), surrounded by flame (3d6), magic weapon required to hit, unaffected by spells from casters lower than 6<sup>th</sup> level.

#### Demon, Balban (Brute Demon)

A balban demon resembles a 12-foot-tall bipedal elephant. Balbans attack with its two fists. If it hits a single opponent with both fists, it pounds the victim into the ground for an additional 2d6 points of damage. Balbans can charge and trample creatures for 2d8 points of damage (save avoids).

- Balban (Brute Demon): **HD** 9; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 2 fists (1d6), 1 bite (1d8); **Move** 14; **Save** 6; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 10/1400; **Special**: Magic resistance (15%), pound, trample

#### Demon, Cambion

When an incubus mates with a human female, the offspring is a cambion. Cambions, unlike their “sisters” the alu-demons, are always chaotic and care little for anyone or anything but their own well-being. They are selfish, self-centered, and egotistical. Cambions hate humans and are often employed as assassins. Cambions are always male. The typical cambion stands 6 or 7 feet tall and weighs 200 pounds or more. It is stocky in build and has scaly skin of various colors, with blue being the most common, small fangs, tiny horns and crimson eyes. Cambions usually speak the common tongue of men, the secret language of demons and at least one other language. Cambions can cast *cause fear, ESP,* *levitate* and *polymorph* *self* at will.

- Cambion: **HD** 8; **AC** 1 \[18\]; **Atk** Weapon or 2 claws (1d6); **Move** 15; **Save** 8; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 12/2000; **Special**: Spells, +1 or better weapon to hit, immune to electricity and poison, magic resistance (20%), telepathy 100 ft.

#### Demon, Coral

Coral demons are often associated with the Demon-Lord Thalasskoptis, although not all coral demons are in his service. These horrific undersea demons are often found leading large bands of water-ghouls and sea-wights when on the material planes of existence. Such a group will generally be composed of 1d6 sea-wights and 1d10+10 water-ghouls.

A coral demon resembles a mass of coral with a vaguely humanoid shape, but with 4 coral-encrusted tentacles reaching from the body along with a pair of pincers. On land, they give off a stench of brine and rot so strongly that anyone coming within 20ft must make a saving throw or become nauseated for 1d6 rounds.

Coral demons have all the normal powers and resistances of demons, taking half damage from electricity, cold, fire, and poison gas. They can only be hit by magical weapons. They are able to cast *darkness* in a radius of 15-ft. and to *teleport* once per day. In addition, coral demons have the ability to *detect invisibility*, cause *fear* (as per a wand), and to *telekinese* 200 pounds of weight, each usable at will. If underwater, a coral demon can summon 1d4 giant sharks, and they can also jet forth a cloud of ink 15-ft. in radius which acts as a *dispel magic* spell (12th level of ability) cast against anyone within the cloud. The cloud persists for 1d3+1 rounds, and anyone remaining inside it for a second round will be treated for each round as if the *dispel magic* had been cast again. They have the ability to *gate* in another coral demon with a chance of 15% on land and 40% if underwater. Finally, all coral demons have magic resistance of 55%.

Clearly, coral demons are considerably weaker on land than under the water, and they seldom venture too far from their natural element. In the dark and dreaded seas of the abyss, coral demons are common, and few other demons venture willingly into the territories they claim as their own. *(Author: Matt Finch)*

#### Demon, Chaaor (Beast Demon)

A chaaor is a 12-foot-tall, hulking, ape-like brute with the head of a bear. Large downward curving, grayish-silver horns grow from its head and end in rounded points. A chaaor’s body is covered in reddish-black fur and is almost always caked or matted in blood. The powerful arms of a chaaor end in razor-sharp and filthy black claws. Long rows of sharpened teeth fill the chaaor’s mouth. When moving, the chaaor usually drops to all fours. When facing an aggressor it assumes a bipedal stance. If a chaaor hits with both claw attacks, it tears the flesh of its opponent for an automatic 2d8 points of damage. Three times per day, a chaaor can let loose a deadly roar that does 3d6 points of damage to all creatures within 60 feet (save for half). At will a chaaor can create *darkness* (15 foot radius) and *teleport*. Chaaor are immune to electricity and poison, and take half damage from cold, fire and acid.

A choronzon is a 20-foot-tall behemoth weighing 9,000 pounds with a muscular demonic body. It has bluish-black scaly flesh and horns and claws. Choronzons radiate confusion (as per the spell of the same name) within 20 feet and its decomposing breath deals 8d6 points of damage in a 50-foot diameter (save for half damage). The massive demon can cause darkness in a 20-foot radius and resists magic.

#### Demon, Corruptor - Azizou (Pain Demon)

The azizou is slightly larger than the barizou and is quite strong for its size. They are relentless combatants and love to inflict pain and suffering on their opponents in combat. Azizoiu have jackal heads, grayish skin covered in patches of course, black hair and large, round eyes with slitpupils of gray. Membranous wings protrude from their backs and their hands and feet end in talons. A combatant who suffers damage from both of an azizou’s claw attacks in the same round suffers an additional 1d6 damage as its flesh is rended. Azizous can cast *cause fear, ESP, invisibility* *(self)* and *stinking cloud.*

- Corruptor Demon - Azizou (Pain Demon): **HD** 4; **AC** 1 \[18\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d4), bite (1d6); **Move** 12/18 (flying); **Save** 13; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 7/600; **Special**: Spells, whisper of madness, rending claws, +1 or better weapon to hit, immunity to electricity and poison, magic resistance (10%), telepathy 100 ft.

#### Demon, Corruptor - Barizou (Assassin Demon)

Called assassin demons or infiltrator demons, the barizou are employed as such because their small size allows them to move unseen in many places larger demons cannot go. They look like gray-skinned halflings with the heads of wolves, membranous wings and talons on their hands and feet. A barizou’s mouth is filled with razor-sharp fangs and its back is mottled with sickly patches of bluish-gray. Barizou can cast *cause fear* and *invisibility (self)* at will. Barizou can alter their coloration to blend with their suroundings, allowing them to surprise on a roll of 1-4 on 1d6. When a barizou attacks a surprised opponent, they can backstab for double damage (as a thief).

- Corruptor Demon - Barizou (Assassin Demon): **HD** 3; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d4), bite (1d6); **Move** 12/18 (flying); **Save** 14; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 6/400; **Special**: Spells, whisper of madness, chamelon, backstab, +1 or better weapon to hit, immunity to electricity and poison, magic resistance (5%), telepathy 100 ft.

#### Demon, Corruptor - Geruzou (Slime Demon)

Geruzou are sometimes called slime demons because their sickly-gray, leathery skin constantly drips and oozes thick, jelly-like mucus. Like their brethren, they are fierce combatants and are often employed as hunters and trackers by greater demons. The typical geruzou stands nearly 4 feet tall and has a horse-like head with downward-curving horns. It has long, sharp teeth exploding from its mouth, stretching its lips back in a perpetual snarl, and taloned hands and feet. A pair of large, membranous wings jut from its back. Three times per day, a geruzou can spit a stream of slimy goo in a 20-foot line. This spit attack requires a ranged attack against an AC of 10 plus its target’s Dexterity bonus to AC (if any). A creature hit by the slime is coated and slowed (as the *slow* spell) for 6 rounds if it fails a saving throw. A geruzou can cast *cause fear, darkness,* *ESP, invisibility (self)* and *mirror image*.

- Corruptor Demon - Geruzou (Slime Demon): **HD** 5; **AC** 0 \[19\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d4), bite (1d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 12; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: Spells, whisper of madness, spit slime, +1 or better weapon to hit, immunity to electricity and poison, magic resistance (15%), telepathy 100 ft.

#### Demon, Daraka (Swarm Demon)

Darakas are 9-foot tall, black-skinned humanoids with the heads of rams. A daraka’s skin is leathery and oily and from a distance of 10 feet or more appears to be a mass of writhing flesh. Closer inspection reveals thousands of tiny scorpions swarming its flesh, skittering in and out of its mouth, ears and nose, seemingly unnoticed by the demon. They act as guards to the greater demons or as shock troops in demonic armies. Quite intelligent, they are often used as commanders or leaders, with each daraka having a battalion of minor demons at its command. Darakas can make themselves *invisible* at will and can cast the spell *feeblemind* once per day. They can sling scorpions at opponents as a range attacks. Those hit are covered in a swarm of the tiny vermin and stung repeatedly for 1d6 points of damage and, if a saving throw is failed, paralysis for 1d4 rounds.

- Demon, Daraka: **HD** 12; **AC** -3 \[22\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d10), bite (2d6) or scorpions (1d6 plus poison); **Move** 15; **Save** 3; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 19/4100; **Special**: Scorpions, spells, magic or silver weapons to hit, immunity to electricity and poison, magic resistance (50%), telepathy 100 ft.

#### Demon, Darkswimmer

Darkswimmers are demons generally associated with the Demon-Princess Teratashia, the ruler of dimensions and spirit bindings. They resemble long, black eels twenty feet in length, with a mouth full of sharp teeth and a pair of short, clawed arms.

These demons are able to shift from one dimension to another at will, allowing them to move through walls and other solid objects and even to disappear into another dimension entirely. Shifting dimensions in this manner requires the demon’s full concentration, but causes the demon to disappear from existence for 1d3 rounds, after which time it will return with 1d4+1 hit points restored.

Darkswimming demons take half damage from electricity, cold, fire, and poison gas, and are immune to non-magical weapons. They are able to cast *darkness* in a radius of 15-ft. at will, *dimension door* and *passwall* once per day, and to *teleport* twice per day. In addition, they have the ability to *detect invisibility*, cause *fear* (as per a wand), and to *telekinese* 200 pounds of weight, each usable at will. A darkswimming demon has the ability to *gate* in 1d2 other darkswimmers (25% chance).

Because these demons swim through water, air, and solids indifferently, treating all as an identical material for travel, they can be found in any element both in the abyss and on the prime material plane. They are 90% resistant to magic. *(Author: Matt Finch)*

- Darkswimmer Demon: **HD** 9; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d6), 1 bite (2d6); **Move** 24 (Fly 24); **Save** 6; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 15/2900; **Special**: Magic resistance (90%), hit only by magic weapons, demonic immunities and magical powers, *gate* (25%).

#### Demon, Dretch

These creatures are fat, with long, spindly arms and legs. They have rudimentary human heads, with slobbering jaws and folds of fat. Wretch demons have some weak demonic powers. Although they are not particularly intelligent, they can cause a horrible stinking cloud once per day, can teleport once per day, can cause darkness (10 ft. diameter) once per day, and can summon 1d4 giant rats once per day. The stinking cloud has a radius of 20ft and requires anyone caught within it to make a saving throw or be rendered helpless from nausea for 1d4+1 rounds.

- Dretch Demon: **HD** 4; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d4), 1 bite (1d6); **Move** 9; **Save** 13; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 6/400; **Special**: Magical abilities.

#### Demon, Erinyes

The erinyes, the “furies” of Ancient Greek mythology, are female demons who pursue those guilty of crimes against the order of the gods. Their appearance is so terrible as to cause *fear* (saving throw). They are impossible to hide from, being able to see invisible things and locate objects at will. The furies carry a whip, which, if it hits, entangles the victim (saving throw) until the fury releases it. The furies are immune to fire and cold, and have a magic resistance of 25%. The blade of a fury’s sword causes *paralysis* (saving throw).

- Erinyes Demon: **HD** 6; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 1 bronze sword (1d6 + paralysis); **Move** 12 (Fly 24); **Save** 11; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 10/1400; **Special**: Magic resistance (25%), magical abilities, fear, immune to fire and cold, entangle.

#### Demon, Gallu- (Faceless Demon)

- Gallu-Demon (Faceless Demon): **HD** 7; **AC** 0 \[19\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d3), 1 bite (2d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 9; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 9/1100; **Special**: Immune to poison and electricity, magical abilities

#### Demon, Gharros (Scorpion Demon)

This hideous creature appears to be half-scorpion and half-human. Its upper torso is that of a greenish-silver humanoid with long, flowing dark hair and stark white eyes while its lower torso is that of a reddish-brown scorpion. Its tail splits into two separate stingers and the creature’s mouth is filled with razor-sharp teeth. Gharros serve as guards, soldiers, shock troops and assassins to some of the minor nobles and lesser demon lords of the Abyss. The poison from the gharros’ scorpion sting is lethal if one fails a saving throw. Gharros can cast the spells *darkness* and *mirror image* at will.

- Gharros Demon (Scorpion Demon): **HD** 16; **AC** -3 \[22\]; **Atk** Axe (2d8) and 2 tail stings (1d8 plus poison); **Move** 12; **Save** 3; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 22/5000; **Special**: Poison, spells, +1 or better weapon to hit, immune to electricity and poison, magic resistance (50%), telepathy 100 ft.

#### Demon, Glabrezu (Third-Category Demon)

The third-category demons, Glabrezu, are massive and horrible, standing ten feet high or more. They have goat horns and humanoid shape, with no wings. Four arms sprout from the torso: two huge arms with great crab-pincers, and two much shorter arms with claws. Glabrezu can cause darkness in a 10ft radius, are immune to fire, can cause Fear at will, can levitate at will, can polymorph themselves, and are 60% resistant to magic. These demons have a 30% chance to *gate* in an ally (roll 1d4 to determine the category of demon that responds).

#### Demon, Greruor (Frog Demon)

A greruor is a squat, bloated, frog-like demon with arms in place of its forelegs. Its wide, frog-like head has two 3-foot-long horns protruding just above its deep, sunken eyes. It moves by hopping on its rear legs, leaping up to 20 feet. Its arms end in talons that are usually clutched around the greruor’s deadly ranseur (2d6). Its huge mouth sports razor-sharp teeth of a dull gray color. The greruor’s flesh is greenish-brown mottled with red or gray. Its skin constantly oozes and secretes a thick, mucus-like clear slime. Once every 1d4 rounds, a greruor can spit a line of acid up to 30 feet that deals 4d4 points of damage. On the greruor’s next turn, the acid ignites and the opponent bursts into flame and takes 1d6 points of damage per round until extinguished. A save halves the acid damage and prevents the creature from bursting into flame. At will, a greruor can cause *confusion*, create *darkness* (15 foot radius), *hold person* and *detect good*. Greruor are immune to electricity and poison, and take half damage from cold, fire, and acid.

#### Demon, Grimlek

Grimleks are large wolf-like demons covered in dark, ratty fur. Their most striking features are over-sized canines that prevent their mouths from closing and their lack of eyes. The absence of eyes does not negatively affect them. They are often used in the service of powerful demons and sorcerers as guards, trackers, or assassins.

A Grimlek may “latch on” to a victim after a successful attack, causing 1d6 points of damage every round until the victim is freed from the bite. Their bites can also cause a lycanthropic-like disease if the victim is not cured before the next new moon, at which point the infected person will become a hybrid similar to a werewolf. At this point even more powerful healing magics are needed to reverse the effects before the following new moon or the person will fully transform into a Grimlek and be lost forever.*(Author: the Lizard of Oz).*

- Grimlek: **HD** 5+3; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 1 bite (2d6); **Move** 24; **Save** 12; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 7/600; **Special**: Disease, continuous damage.

#### Demon, Hezrou (Second-Category Demon)

Toad-like demons with bat wings, the Hezrou have magic resistance of 50%. At will, they can cause *fear* (per the spell), *detect invisibility* (per the spell), and cause *darkness 15-ft. radius*. They are immune to fire. Hezrou have a 20% chance to succeed at summoning another second-category demon to their aid.

#### Demon, Khavorr (Third-Category Demon)

Khavorr demons are considered to be a third-category demon, although they are unrelated to the more commonly summoned Glabrezu type. They resemble grossly fat humans, or perhaps giants, for they stand 10 ft. in height. A Khavorr demon has the head of an alligator, and these powerful jaws are a terrible weapon.

Khavorrs take only half damage from electricity, cold, fire, and poison gas. They are able to cast *darkness* in a radius of 15-ft. at will, and to *teleport* once per day. In addition, they have the ability to *detect invisibility*, cause *fear* (as per a wand), and to *telekinese* 300 pounds of weight, any of these abilities being employed at will. Khavorrs can *polymorph* themselves into massive alligators or into a human shape, and can cast *charm monster* 3 times per day.

Khavorr demons can be damaged by normal weapons. A Khavorr demon can attempt to *gate* in another demon with a 30% chance of success. The demon appearing may be of Category 1, 2, or 3 (roll 1d3 to determine). *(Author: Matt Finch)*

- Third-Category [Demon](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Demons) (KhavorrType): **HD** 10; **AC** -3 \[22\]; **Atk**2 claws (1d10), 1 bite (3d6); **Move** 9; **Save** 5; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 13/2300; **Special**: Magic resistance 55%, demonic magical powers.

#### Demon, Larvaxu (Second-Category Demon)

The Laravaxu are a second form of Type II demon existing in the depths of the abyss in addition to the better-documented Hezrou form. Laravaxu take half damage from electricity, cold, fire, and poison gas. They are able to cast *darkness* in a radius of 15-ft. at will, and to *teleport* twice per day. In addition, they have the ability to *detect invisibility*, cause *fear* (as per a wand), and to *telekinese* 200 pounds of weight, each usable at will.

Laravaxu have the form of a massive, slimy grub with a huge mouth. They cannot be damaged with blunt weapons, but normal piercing or cutting weapons will damage them. The Laravaxu’s only attack is its bite, but if the demon rolls a natural 19 or 20 on its to-hit roll, the opponent has been swallowed whole. Any creature swallowed by the demon will be turned into a demonic larva within 1d3+5 melee rounds unless the Laravaxu is killed.

A Laravaxu demon has the ability to *gate* in another Category 2 demon (20% chance of success). When a Laravaxu successfully *gates* in another demon, there is a 50% chance that the summoned demon will be a Hezrou and a 50% chance that it will be another Laravaxu. If several demons end up being summoned into the battle, if the Hezrou outnumber the Laravaxu by 2:1 or more, the Hezrou will fall upon the Laravaxu and attempt to kill them. *(Author: Matt Finch)*

#### Demon, Lemure

Lemures are vaguely humanoid, but their flesh is mud-like, shifting and soft upon their horrible bodies. (This amorphous form allows them to regenerate 1 hp per round.) Lemures are lower forms of demons, the fleshly manifestations of damned souls. These demons can be permanently destroyed only by sprinkling their disgusting bodies with holy water.

A mallor is a 10- to 12-foot-long, powerful humanoid with the lower torso of a giant coral snake. Its humanoid frame is crimson-colored while its snake body is black with bands of yellow and red. Its arms end in sharpened claws, slightly curved under, just enough to tear through flesh, sinew and muscle. Mallors have black, gold, or amber hair. Their eyes are white with red or green pupils. Anyone meeting a mallor’s gaze must save or flee in fear for 1d6 rounds. All liquids, including potions, within 100 feet of a mallor automatically become foul and unsuitable to drink. Anyone drinking the water must save or become nauseated for 1 minute. A mallor injects a virulent poison when it hits an opponent with its claws. At will, a mallor can use *burning hands, dispel magic* and *teleport*. Once per day, a mallor can summon 1d6 giant vipers with a 50% chance of success. Mallors are immune to electricity and poison, and take half damage from cold, fire and acid.

#### Demon, Marilith (Fifth-Category Demon)

Mariliths appear as a cruel-eyed beautiful woman with a six-armed torso, but the lower body of a huge constrictor snake. They can wield weapons in all six arms at once, and the tail, if it hits, constricts for automatic damage after the initial hit. Mariliths are among the most feared of demons – as much, even, as the mighty Baalrochs. They can, at will, cast *Charm Person*, *Levitate*, and *Polymorph Self*, and are 80% resistant to magic. Fire does not affect them. They have a 50% chance of success when attempting to gate in allies; if the attempt succeeds, roll 1d12 to determine the result. (1-3) First-category, (4-6) Second-category, (7-8) Third-category, (9-10) Fourth-category, (11) Sixth-category, (12) a demonlord or demon prince.

#### Demon, Mezzalorn (Wasp Demon)

A mezzalorn looks like a hellish giant wasp with the head and torso of a man. When reduced to half its hit points it releases a pheromone that gives it and all other mezzalorns a +1 to-hit bonus. The poison injected by a mezzalorn’s stinger is lethal if the victim fails a saving throw.

- Mezzalorn Demon (Wasp Demon): **HD** 12; **AC** -3 \[22\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d6), 1 sting (2d6 + poison); **Move** 6/14 (flying); **Save** 3; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 13/2300; **Special**: Magic resistance (10%), immune to poison

#### Demon, Nalfeshnee (Fourth-Category Demon)

Nalfeshnee demons have the body of an enormous gorilla, the head of a boar, and cloven hooves. These massive, brutish demons are actually quite intelligent, despite their appearance, an incongruity that has deceived and doomed many who would attempt to control or enslave them. The very size of a nalfeshnee prevents them from being particularly agile flyers, though they do have wings. Nalfeshnee are incredibly powerful (+2 to hit), and have various demonic powers in addition to being immune to fire: they cause fear as per the spell (at will), polymorph self (at will) and dispel magic (at will). They can create a symbol of discord once per day. A nalfeshnee demon has a 60% chance to *gate* in an ally (roll 1d6 to determine which category of demon will respond).

#### Demon, Nerizo (Hound Demon)

The bestial nerizo can be found on almost all planes of the Abyss. More animalistic than not, the nerizo are sometimes used as “hunting dogs” by the greater demons and lords. Neziro are man-sized demons with dark, blue-black skin. Their arms end in clawed hands and their legs in cloven hooves. They have long, barbed tails. These barbed tails deliver a poison that causes lethargy and weakness in the limbs; victims must pass a saving throw or suffer a -1 penalty to hit and damage and a 1 point penalty to AC. Once per hour, a nerizo can spit a glob of stomach bile in a 10-foot line. A creature hit takes 2d6 points of damage (saving throw allowed for half damage). Nerizos can cast *confusion* once per day.

- Nerizo (Hound Demon): **HD** 10; **AC** -1 \[20\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d6), tail sting (1d6 plus poison); **Move** 15; **Save** 5; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 17/3500; **Special**: Poison, spit acid, spells, magic or silver weapons to hit, immune to electricity and poison, magic resistance (35%)

#### Demon, Nysrock (Cobra Demon)

A nysrock is a 14-foot-long cobra-like demon with a humanoid head. After a nysrock hits with its bite, it automatically constricts for 1d8 points of damage per round thereafter. The poison of a nysrock deals 1d6 points of damage each round until healing is applied. A nysrock can spit poison up to 40 feet. The poison spit causes blindness unless a saving throw is made.

- Nysrock (Cobra Demon): **HD** 10; **AC** 0 \[19\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d8), 1 sting (2d4 + poison); **Move** 12; **Save** 5; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 12/2000; **Special**: Constrict, immune to poison, spit poison

#### Demon, Ooze

Ooze demons are the forgotten children of Jubilex, The Faceless Lord, faithful servants that obey the will of their master without question. When the Faceless Lord went missing (see the module, ***G5 Chaos Rising***, by **Necromancer Games** for details) the ooze demons formed search parties and scoured the planes for signs of his whereabouts.

Ooze demons, both lesser and greater, appear as a combination of ooze and demon. An ooze demon resembles a humanoid with a long, crocodilian snout, razor-sharp teeth, and long talons. From a distance, this monster looks like a typical demon (if such a thing exists). Up close, the horror is easily ascertainable; the creature is actually a single entity of swirling black and white or black and gray ooze in the shape of a humanoid.

- Greater Ooze Demon: **HD** 10; **AC** 0 \[19\]; **Atk** 1 slam (1d8) or bite (1d8 + 1d6 acid) and 2 claws (1d6 + 1d6 acid); **Move** 6; **Save** 5; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 13/2300; **Special**: Acid, summon demons, vomit
- Lesser Ooze Demon: **HD** 4; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 1 slam (1d6) or bite (1d6 + 1d4 acid) and 2 claws (1d4 + 1d4 acid); **Move** 6; **Save** 13; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 6/400; **Special**: Acid, summon demons

#### Demon, Quasit

Quasits are demon familiars, much like imps but without wings and with a less human-like shape. A quasit can polymorph into two other forms (commonly a giant centipede and a bat). These demons are 25% resistant to magic, regenerate at 1hp per round, can become invisible at will, and once per day can cast a Fear spell. Their claws are laden with poison that reduces an opponent’s dexterity by 1 point (saving throw applies, lasts for 2d6 rounds).

- Quasit: **HD** 3; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d2 + non-lethal poison), 1 bite (1d3); **Move** 14; **Save** 14; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 7/600; **Special**: Magic resistance (25%), non-lethal poison, regenerate (1hp/round), magical abilities.

#### Demon, Shaazavi (Fourth-Category Demon)

Shaazavi demons are a fourth-category demon with three vulture-like heads, a human torso, and the legs of a goat.

Shaazavis take only half damage from electricity, cold, fire, and poison gas. They are able to cast *darkness* in a radius of 15-ft. at will, and to *teleport* once per day. In addition, they have the ability to *detect invisibility*, cause *fear* (as per a wand), and to *telekinese* 300 pounds of weight, any of these abilities being employed at will. Shazavis can *polymorph* themselves, and can cast charm monster 3 times per day.

In addition, each head of a Shaazavi demon can employ a breath weapon, although these cannot all be brought to bear in the same direction at one time, each head “covering” a 120-degree angle around the demon. One of the heads can spit a line of acid similar to that of a black dragon; the second head breathes a cone of fire as a red dragon, and the third head exhales a cloud of gas similar to that of a green dragon. Each breath weapon inflicts 5d6 points of damage, with a successful saving throw indicating half damage.

Shaazavi demons cannot be damaged by normal weapons; magic weapons are required to damage them. A Shaazavi demon can attempt to *gate* in another demon with a 60% chance of success. The demon appearing may be of Category 1, 2, 3, or 4 (roll 1d4 to determine type).

Most Shaazavis have individual names. (Author: Matt Finch)

- Shaazavi: **HD** 10; **AC** -1 \[20\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 5; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 15/2900; **Special**: Magic resistance (60%), immune to non-magic weapons, demonic and magical abilities.

#### Demon, Shadow

This creature resembles a living shadow of inky darkness. Large bat-like wings protrude from its form. Shadow demons are the incorporeal form of a demon trapped in the form of a shadow as punishment for some wrongdoing. If anything can release a demon trapped in shadow form, only the dukes, princes, and lords of the Abyss know such secrets. As a result of their new form, shadow demons are especially malign and ill-tempered. In shadows and darkness, a shadow demon surprises foes on a roll of 1-5 on 1d6. Shadow demons are powerless in natural sunlight, and avoid it at all costs. Once per minute, a shadow demon can move at six times its normal speed. Shadow demons can cast *darkness, fear* and *magic jar* (1/week).

- Shadow Demon: **HD** 7; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d6), bite (1d8); **Move** 15 (flying); **Save** 9; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 12/2000; **Special**: Incorporeal, spells, immunity to electricity and poison, shadow blend, sunlight powerlessness, telepathy 100 ft.

#### Demon, Shrroth (Squid Demon)

A shrroth is a 15-foot-tall copper-colored demon with the lower torso of an octopus and the upper torso of a powerful humanoid. Its arms end in 6-fingered talons. Its lower torso sports a mass of writing tentacles reaching lengths of 10 feet. Six larger tentacles stretching 20 feet surround the smaller tentacles. Its mouth is filled with serrated teeth. A mass of long black hair hangs from its head; from under which protrude two forward-curving, blackish horns. If a shrroth hits the same opponent with two tentacles, the victim is constricted for an automatic 2d6 points of damage each round thereafter. A shrroth can emit a cloud of grayish liquid in a 40-foot spread once per minute that conceals the creature (20% chance to miss) and forces any creature in the cloud to save or be sickened for 3 rounds. At will, a shrroth can *dispel* *magic*, create a *mirror image* or *teleport*. Twice a day it can use *feeblemind*, and once per day it can cast *power word blind*. A shrroth can jet backward in a straight line at a speed of 30 once per round. Shrroth are immune to electricity and poison, and take half damage from cold, fire and acid.

- Shrroth (Squid Demon): **HD** 12; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 6 tentacles (2d6), 2 claws (1d6), 1 bite (1d8) and trident (3d6); **Move** 6/18 (swimming); **Save** 3; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 15/2900; **Special**: Constrict, sickness cloud, magical abilities, summon demons, +1 weapons to hit

#### Demon, Skitterdark

Skitterdarks are small humanoid-shaped creature no more than 1 foot tall with crimson leathery bat wings. Its body is blood red and somewhat stocky for its size. Its hands end in sharp claws and its eyes and teeth are sickly yellow. Skitterdarks are commonly found in groups and sometimes use poison on their weapons.

- Skitterdark Demon: **HD** 2; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d2), 1 bite (1d2), or 1 weapon (1d3); **Move** 8/12 (flying); **Save** 16; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**: Magic resistance (5%), immune to electricity, poison

#### Demon, Stirge

One of the most foul and despicable of all demonkind, the stirge demon hates all other demonic races and usually attacks them on sight. It savors the blood of vrocks and hezrous, but generally avoids any more powerful demonic races. Stirge demons look like a cross between a human, stirge and demonic fly. They have four, stirge-like hind legs and human forearms that end in chitinous, claw-like fingers. Stirge demons have the wings of stirges and human heads topped with bristly manes. Stirge demons have long, sharp noses that are used to pierce the flesh and draw blood.

Stirge demons can drain blood by making a successful bite attack and rolling a natural ‘20’. The stirge deals 1d4 points of damage per round until the victim succeeds on an open doors check and breaks its hold.

Stirge demons constantly emit a droning sound from their winfs. All creatures within a 60-foot spread that hear it must succeed on a saving throw or fall into a comatose sleep for 1d4 hours.

Stirge demons can walk on walls, floors, ceilings, and other such surfaces at their normal movement rate. This is an inherent ability and cannot be dispelled or negated.

- Stirge Demon: **HD** 8; **AC** 0 \[19\]; **Atk** 2 claws (2d6), bite (1d10); **Move** 9/24 (flying); **Save** 8; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 16/3200; **Special**: Blood drain, drone, spells, magic or silver weapons to hit, immunity to electricity and poison, magic resistance (40%), spider climb, telepathy 100 ft.

#### Demon, Succubus

A succubus is a creature of demonic lust, a drinker of souls who offers fatal temptation to mortals that fall into the trap of her deadly embraces: each kiss drains one level of experience. (The male form of this demon is called an incubus. A succubus is always female, just as an incubus is always male.) The demon’s form is that of a supernaturally beautiful woman, curvaceous and alluring, but whose furled bat wings and delicate horns betray her true nature. Small white fangs gleam from behind the demoness’s full lips, and when she is enraged the pupils of her eyes will contract and shift into those of a vicious serpent.

A succubus can “cast” *Charm Person* whenever desired, as well as *ESP*, *Clairaudience*, and *Suggestion*. They can change shape at will, but only into human or human-like forms. Succubi also have the ability to call forth (by gate) other demons. A succubus can summon a demon prince (40% chance to succeed), but will seldom do so, for the price to be paid afterwards is generally significant and unpleasant. However, a succubus can summon a Baalroch demon or a Nalfeshnee (fourth-category demon), again, with a 40% chance of success regardless of the type of demon being summoned. If a succubus does not specify the sort of demon she is summoning, there is a 5% chance that the respondent will be a demon prince, and if not, there is a 75% chance that the demon will be of the fourth category, a Nalfeshnee.

Succubi almost never rely upon physical attacks; they use their charm and suggestion abilities to allow them to bestow their deadly kisses upon opponents.

- Succubus: **HD** 6; **AC** 9 \[10\]; **Atk** 2 scratches (1d3); **Move** 12 (Fly 18); **Save** 11; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 9/1,100; **Special**: Magic resistance (70%), immune to non-magic weapons, cause darkness in a 10-foot diameter, level drain (1 level) with kiss, summon other demons, spells,change shape.

#### Demon, Vrock (First-Category Demon)

These demons are vulture-headed, with feathered but humanoid bodies, and huge dark-feathered wings. All can create darkness in a radius of 5-ft. and are immune to fire. They use their wings to allow both their arms and legs to be brought into combat, along with their beaked bite. Vrock demons are quite stupid, though like most demons they consider themselves to be tremendously intelligent. A Vrock has a 10% chance to *gate* another first-category demon to its assistance.

- Vrock Demon: **HD** 8; **AC** 0 \[19\]; **Atk** 1 beak (1d6), 2 foreclaws (1d8), 2 rear claws (1d6); **Move** 12 (Fly 18); **Save** 8; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 11/1700; **Special**: Magic resistance (50%), darkness, immune to fire.

#### Demon, Yildra

Yildra demons are servitors of Yildraathu, the Demon-Lord of Pestilence, and as such they are not considered to be a general demonic “type.” The Yildra take the form of massive rats standing on their hind legs, their fur crawling with vermin and their skin mottled with rot and mange. The demon’s long tail bears a wicked barb at the end, and their claws drip with foul ichor.

The claws of a Yildra carry disease, and the barb on the demon’s tail carries a lethal poison. The diseased claws have the immediate effect (if a saving throw fails) of causing the diseased victim to move at half speed as if affected by a *slow* spell, and the disease will eventually cause death in 2d6 days if it is not magically cured.

Yildras take only half damage from electricity, cold, fire, and poison gas. They are able to cast *darkness* in a radius of 15-ft. at will, and to *teleport* once per day. In addition, they have the ability to *detect invisibility*, cause *fear* (as per a wand), and to *telekinese* 300 pounds of weight, any of these abilities being employed at will. Yildras can attempt to summon another Yildra demon, but this can be attempted only once per day and has only a 10% chance of success.

Yildras can be hit with normal weapons, but such weapons have a penalty of -1 to hit and damage against the demon.

- Yildra Demon: **HD** 7; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d6 + slow), 1 bite (1d8), tail (1d4 + poison); **Move** 9; **Save** 9; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 12/2000; **Special**: Disease, poison, magic resistance (50%), darkness, demonic immunities.

#### Demon Lord, Baphomet (Demon Lord of Beasts)

Baphomet is the demon prince of brutes, most especially ogres and minotaurs, but also bull-headed humans and petty tyrants. His iron keep is located within a large stone cavern on a desolate plane of the Abyss. It is said his castle is a maze of twisting rooms and corridors, with his personal throne room located at the heart of his maze keep. Those that have ventured there remember little about the place other than the never-ending corridors and maze of rooms. Baphomet stands 12 feet tall and weighs about 4,500 pounds. He looks like a powerfully muscled minotaur, his body covered in shaggy, black fur and marred with battle scars. Baphomet wields a wicked-looking *+2 halberd*. When the halberd causes damage on an armored opponent, it reduces the armor value (i.e. the AC bonus afforded by the armor) by 2 points.

Baphomet is a dangerous combatant. Once every 1d4 rounds, he can belch forth a stream of unholy water in a 10-foot line at a single target. Lawful creatures take 10d6 points of damage (saving throw allowed for half damage). Neutral and chaotic creatures are unaffected. Three times per day, Baphomet can unleash a roar that instills fear in those within 30 feet that hear it and fail a saving throw.

Baphomet can cast spells as a 12th level magic-user. He can cast *darkness, dispel magic, maze, passwall* and *wall of iron* three times per day each as magical abilities. Baphomet can summon 2d10 minotaurs per day.

#### Servants of Baphomet

Followers of Baphomet are usually minotaurs or brutish humanoids like ogres, orcs or humans, and consist of clerics, necromancers, and sorcerers or adepts. Clerics of Baphomet are called Horned Ones and must sign a pact of evil with Baphomet. Horned ones are granted access to up to 3rd level cleric spells.

- Baphomet: **HD** 25 (115 hp); **AC** -5 \[24\]; **Atk** Gore (2d6), bite (1d8), weapon (2d6+2); **Move** 18; **Save** 3; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 34/5600; **Special**: Roar, breath weapon, spells, +1 or better weapon to hit, immune to electricity, poison and charm, magic resistance (75%), teleapthy 100 ft.

#### Demon Lord, Beluiri (The Temptress)

Beluiri is a bronze-skinned feminine demon standing about 6 feet tall. Her head is hairless and features four downward-curving horns jutting just above her forehead. The two lower horns are smaller than the topmost horns. A ridge of small spines runs from her brow down the center of her head and tapers off just below her shoulder blades. Her hands end in razor-sharp talons and her eyes are sapphire blue. Beluiri is one of the many concubines of Lord Baphomet (and one of his favorites). She is known throughout the Abyss as the Temptress, for in her many disguises she has seduced countless princes, lords, and generals of the demons. She sometimes journeys to the Material Plane (in one of her many guises) to tempt and seduce mortals, for she knows that all mortals, in their hearts, always give in to their true desires—be they power, greed, lust, or one of many countless other sins. Beluiri rarely wears clothing, but at times when she does, she enjoys gowns and robes of gold, white, and red.

Beluiri is a cunning combatant, preferring subterfuge to direct assaults, luring her victims by assuming a pleasing and non-threatening form. Three times per day she can turn her gaze upon a creature within 30 feet. The target of her gaze must pass a saving throw or become her slave, per a more powerful version of the charm monster spell. Her claws are coated with a debilitating poison that saps a person of their strength. Victims of the poison must pass a saving throw or temporarily lose 2d4 points of Strength (to a minimum of 1) for 1 hour.

Through body language and movement, Beluiri can fascinate all creatures of the opposite sex (which could be either sex, depending on her current form) within 30 feet that observe her dancing. Those viewing this dance must succeed on a saving throw or fall under her influence for 1d6+1 hours as if affected by a charm monster spell. In addition, Beluiri can cast the following spells: *Cause fear, darkness, dispel magic,* *polymorph self* and *wall of fire.* Beluiri is completely immune to illusions and can see invisible creatures.

- Beluiri (The Temptress): **HD** 16 (70 hp); **AC** -2 \[21\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d8 plus poison); **Move** 15; **Save** 3; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 25/5900; **Special**: Dominating gaze, poison, seduction, spells, true sight, +1 or better weapon to hit, immune to electricity and poison, magic resistance (65%), telepathy 100 ft.

#### Demon Lord, Caizel (Deposed Queen of Succubi)

Caizel is an astonishingly beautiful creature standing just under 6 feet tall. Her skin is delicate, soft, and copper in color. Her eyes are blue-green. Two tiny horns are hidden beneath her long, raven-black hair. Her hands, while clawed, are shapely and delicate. Small leather wings protrude from her back, but she usually keeps these hidden beneath her robes and gowns. Caizel’s body courses with a virulent poison that she can intensify or suppress at will. It is not secreted through her skin (therefore her touch is not poisonous); rather it is delivered through the exchange of body fluids with another creature (kissing, consummating an encounter, etc.). At will she can cast charm monster, create darkness (15 foot radius), *detect good, teleport, read magic*, use *suggestion* and create a *wall of fire*. Once per day she can cast mirror image. Once per round, Caizel’s touch can flood a creature’s mind with pleasurable images if it fails a save. This stuns the creature for 1d4 rounds. Caizel is immune to electricity and poison, and takes half damage from cold, fire and acid. Any creature she hits with Bonerazor, her +2 dagger, must save or be held (as by a *hold person* spell).

- Caizel (Deposed Queen of Succubi): **HD** 18; **AC** -4 \[23\]; **Atk** *+2 dagger of returning* (Bonerazor) (2d4 + *hold person*) or 2 claws (1d6+3); **Move** 12; **Save** 3; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 22/5000; **Special**: Poison, magical abilities, summon demons, touch of ecstasy, +1 magic weapons to hit, immune to electricity and poison, resists cold, fire and acid

#### Demon Lord, Dagon (Demon Prince of the Sea)

Dagon is the demon prince of sea creatures. He is worshipped as a deity by legions of sahuagin, locathah, lizardfolk, tritons (those that have accepted the ways of chaos) and some merfolk. Dagon makes his home in a great underwater iron citadel called Thos located in the deepest recesses of his home plane. Dagon appears as a 10-foot tall merman and weighs about 2,000 pounds. He has blue-green skin and the lower torso of a black-scaled leviathan. A thin, translucent fin runs the length of his back, and a long mane of black hair falls from his head and down his finned back. His eyes are deep purple with glowing motes of crimson floating in them.

Dagon is a master of the seas. He is immune to all water-based spells and effects. When fighting in water, he gains a +2 bonus to hit and improves his AC by 2. As their prince, he can summon 20 HD worth of aquatic creatures per day and communicate with them telepathically.

Dagon casts spells as a 12th level magic-user. He has the following magical abilities: *Control water, create water, darkness, dispel magic,* *water breathing* and *feeblemind* (1/day).

Dagon wields a +3 trident that can telescope to up to 20 feet long on its master’s command. The trident is forged of black bronze with adamantine barbs. Creatures struck by the trident and suffering more than 10 points of damage are caught on the barbs, suffering an addition 1d4 points of damage per round and unable to move until they make a successful open doors roll. Creatures that extract themselves from the trident suffer 1d8 points of damage from their rending of their flesh by the barbs.

#### Servants of Dagon

Followers of Dagon are mermen, locathah, sahuagin, lizardmen and evil humanoids that revere the seas and oceans. Clerics of Dagon are called Scaled Ones and must sign a pact of evil with Dagon. Scaled Ones can receive up to 3rd level spells from Dagon.

- Dagon (Demon Prince of the Sea): **HD** 20 (110 hp); **AC** -5 \[24\]; **Atk** *+3 trident* (2d6+3) or 2 meaty fists (1d10); **Move** 9/24 (swimming); **Save** 3; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 30/7400; **Special**: Spells, master of the waters, summon sea creatures, only harmed by +2 or better weapons, immune to cold, electricity and poison, immune to water-based spells, magic resistance (80%), telepathy 100 ft.

#### Demon Lord, Fraz-Urb'luu (Demon Prince of Deception)

Fraz-Urb’luu appears as a hulking, ape-like creature standing nearly three times as tall as a normal human. His head sports large, fan-like, pointed ears and a large, round mouth lined with sharpened teeth. His skin is gray and covered with fine, thin blue hair. A long, serpentine tail, gray and yielding to blue near the barbed end, trails behind him. Two large bat-like wings protrude from his back. Fraz-Urb’luu is one of the most physically powerful demon princes as well as one of the most cunning. His deceptions range far and wide, affecting and influencing not only those on the Material Plane but also other demon princes and demon lords. His malevolent nature lends itself well to his trickery and deception, and he bends others to do his will. Those that oppose him are quickly dispatched. Those he favors are often captured and taken back to his lair in the Abyss where they are forced into a life of servitude. When the day comes that Fraz-Urb’luu grows weary of them, he devours them or throws them to his other servants to do with as they wish. He makes his home deep within the Abyss on a smoldering and scarred layer devoid of most life. His keep is a large iron and stone castle situated near the very center of the layer. A constant stream of traffic emanates to and from his castle; demons and slaves tending to their daily tasks.

If Fraz-Urb’luu strikes the same creature with both of its clobber attacks in a single round it hugs them for an additional 1d12 points of damage and gains a +2 bonus to hit with his bite attack.

Fraz-Urb’luu is immune to all charms, compulsions and phantasms. He casts spells as a 12th level magic-user and can use the following magical abilities: *Charm monster, darkness, dispel magic, ESP, polymorph other* (1/day), *polymorph self* (3/day), *power word blind* (1/day), *prismatic* *sphere* (1/day) and *suggestion*. Once per day, Fraz-Urb’luu can attempt to summon a demon lord or demon prince with a 70% chance of success, and deceive the summoned demon into believing it was called by his opponents. The summoned lord or prince must succeed on a saving throw at -10 or fall for the deception.

#### Servants of Fraz-Urb'luu

Followers of Fraz-Urb’luu are usually evil humanoids and consist of charlatans, clerics, magic-users, politicians and aristocrats. Clerics of Fraz-Urb’luu are called Deceivers and must sign a pact of evil with Fraz-Urb’luu. Deceivers can receive spells up to 3rd level from Fraz-Urb’luu and are granted access to the magic-user spells *phantasmal force* and *suggestion* as though they were cleric spells of the same level.

- Fraz-Urb'luu (Demon Prince of Deception): **HD** 25 (130 hp); **AC** -3 \[22\]; **Atk** 2 clobbers (1d12), bite (1d10) or tail slash (2d6); **Move** 15/24 (flying); **Save** 3; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 35/8900; **Special**: Gnashing teeth, spells, summon demonic entity, +2 or better weapon to hit, immunity to electricity and poison, sealed mind, magic resistance (75%), telepathy 100 ft.

#### Demon Lord, Jubilex (The Faceless Lord)

Jubilex is a large, bubbling mass of greenish-black, foul-smelling liquid. Ooze, slime, and pus constantly squirt and seep from its form. Deep within the oozing form you notice several large red eyes. Jubilex is the ruler over all slimes, oozes, jellies, and other disgusting and foul ooze-like creatures – the cosmic ooze from which the forces of Law crafted reality and back to which reality always threatens to sink. Known by some as the Faceless Lord, his Abyssal home is a steaming, bubbling lair of putrid ooze and slime pits that are constantly shifting and changing at his whim. Even the other demonic rulers loathe to journey here. Jubilex makes his home in a huge slime pit somewhere on one of the many planes he controls. He is constantly attended by and surrounded with all sorts of slimes and oozes.

When confronted, he takes the form of a 12-foot tall column of bubbling and squirting ooze. Jubilex attacks with 10-foot long slimy appendages that emerge from its form. The demon prince secretes a digestive acid that dissolves organic material and metal quickly, but does not affect stone. Any melee hit deals 2d6 points of acid damage. Armor or clothing dissolves and becomes useless immediately unless the wearer succeeds on a saving throw. A metal or wooden weapon that strikes Jubilex also dissolves immediately unless the wielder succeeds on a saving throw. The save DCs are Constitution-based.

Once every six rounds, Jubilex can fire a stream of acidic slime in a 20-foot line. This requires a successful ranged attack that ignores armor. A creature hit takes 2d6 points of acid damage (save for half) and 1d6 points of acid damage on each round it remains on the target. On the first round after striking a target, the slime may be scraped off (most likely destroying the scraper in the process), but after that it must be burnt, frozen, or cut away (applying damage to the victim as well). Extreme cold or heat, sunlight, or a *cure disease* spell destroys the slime.

Jubilex can cast spells as a 15th level cleric. He can also use the following magical abilities: *Circle of cold* (emanate cold in a 10-ft. radius; 5d6 damage, save for half damage, lasts 1 minute per level), *cause disease* (reverse of *cure disease*), *darkness, dispel magic, ESP, hold monster,* *invisibility (self), symbol of insanity and wall of acid* (as *wall of fire,* but deals acid damage). He is immune to illusions and can see invisible creatures without difficulty. Once per day, Jubilex can summon up to 2d4 ochre jellies, gray oozes, or gelatinous cubes, or 1d4 black puddings. Because of his ooze-like structure, Jubilex is immune to *sleep* effects, paralysis, polymorph, and stunning.

#### Servants of Fraz-Urb'luu

Followers of Jubilex are evil humanoids with an affinity for slimes, jellies, and all things that ooze. Clerics of Jubilex are called Masters of the Ooze and must sign a pact of evil with Jubilex. Masters of the Ooze can receive spells up to 3rd level from Jubilex and are granted access to the circle of cold and wall of acid spells described above. *Circle of cold* is a 5th level cleric spell and *wall of acid* is a 5th level cleric spell.

- Jubilex (The Faceless Lord): **HD** 20 (120 hp); **AC** -2 \[21\]; **Atk** Slam (3d6); **Move** 9/24 (flying); **Save** 3; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 30/7400; **Special**: Acid slime, spells, summon oozes, +3 or better weapon to hit, immunity to electricity and poison, magic resistance (80%), telepathy 100 ft.

#### Demon Lord, Kostchtchie (Demon Prince of Wrath)

Kostchtchie is the demon lord of cold and is the epitome of hatred and evil. If there is a demon lord more ruthless and malevolent than he, that lord has never made his presence known. Kostchtchie is hated by all (including other demon lords and princes). He moves across his Abyssal landscape with a shuffling gait, and is rarely, if ever, encountered alone. He appears as a 10 foot tall, ogrish creature, with yellowish skin and hairless save for it bushy eyebrows. He has two twisted, stumpy legs and a thick torso. His head is flat and oval and sports two large, sunken, crystal-blue eyes of immeasurable beauty. Kostchtchie’s Abyssal home is a frigid and mountainous realm of ice, rock, snow, and subfreezing temperatures. Unprotected travelers and those vulnerable to cold do not last long here.

Kostchtchie wields a cold-wrought *+3 warhammer* that must be wielded with two hands. It creates a cacophonous roar like thunder upon striking with a successful critical hit, deafening those who fail a saving throw. When Kostchtchie’s attack roll is a natural ‘20’, the hammer leaves a thick layer of frost and ice on whatever it strikes, causing an additional 1d6 points of freezing damage.

Kostchtchie can cast spells as a 12th level magic-user. He can cast *cause serious wounds* (reverse of cure serious wounds), *charm monster,* *darkness* and *dispel magic* at will. Three times per day he can summon 1d4 frost giants or 1 large, adult white dragon.

#### Servants of Kostchtchie

Followers of Kostchtchie are usually berserkers, frost giants and ogres. Clerics of Kostchtchie are called Ice Lords and must sign a pact of evil with Kostchtchie. Ice Lords cast receive spells up to 3rd level from Kostchtchie.

- Kostchtchie (Demon Prince of Wrath): **HD** 15 (100 hp); **AC** -4 \[23\]; **Atk** *+3 warhammer* (3d6); **Move** 9; **Save** 3; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 23/5300; **Special**: Spells, +1 or better weapon to hit, immune to cold, electricity and poison, magic resistance (60%), telepathy 100 ft.

#### Demon Lord, Maphistal (Second of Orcus)

Maphistal is the second of Orcus, Demon Prince of the Undead. He makes his home on a stinking, smoldering layer of the Abyss and commands his troops from his great castle, Maalstege (The Keep of Bones, so called because it is believe to be constructed from the skeletal remains of those slain by Maphistal). He is loyal to no one but Orcus. He does not trust Sonechard, the General of Orcus’s undead legions, and seeks to discredit him at any opportunity, though he does not do this openly for fear of rebellion by his troops or punishment by Orcus. His machinations against Sonechard are primarily through his agents and spies in Sonechard’s camps.

Maphistal stands 9 feet tall and weighs 700 pounds. He is a feral-looking humanoid with two great horns protruding from his head and huge, bat wings sprouting from his shoulders. His legs end in sooty hooves and short, coarse, black hair covers his body save his face and clawed hands.

Maphistal’s *+3 heavy mace* deals an extra 1d6 points of damage against lawful creatures and it drains one level from any lawful creature attempting to wield it. Each time a living creature is hit by Maphistal’s mace, it must succeed on a saving throw or lose 1d4 points of Dexterity as its bones fuse together. Creatures reduced to 0 Dexterity can no longer move or attack. Only a *restoration* spell can repair this damage, restoring 1d4 points of Dexterity with each application.

Maphistal’s bite infects victims with a demonic fever that incubates for 1 day and then begins inflicting 1d6 points of Constitution damage each day until the afflicted succeeds at a saving throw at a -3 penalty.

Maphistal can cast the following spells: *Animate dead, darkness, dispel* *magic, power word stun* and *suggestion*. Once per day, Maphistal can summon 3d10 zombies or skeletons, 2d6 ghouls, 2d4 ghasts, 1d6 wraiths or wights, or 1d4 spectres.

- Maphistal (Second of Orcus): **HD** 20 (90 hp); **AC** -3 \[22\]; **Atk** *+3 heavy mace* (2d6) and bite (1d8 plus disease) or 2 claws (1d8) and bite (1d8 plus poison); **Move** 15/30 (flying); **Save** 3; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 30/7400; **Special**: Bone knit, disease, spells, summon undead, +1 or better weapon to hit, immunity to electricity and poison, magic resistance (70%), telepathy 100 ft.

#### Demon Lord, Orcus (Demon Prince of the Undead)

Orcus is the Prince of the Undead, and it said that he alone created the first undead that walked the worlds.

Orcus is one of the strongest (if not the strongest) and most powerful of all demon lords. He fights a never-ending war against rival demon princes that spans several Abyssal layers. From his great bone palace he commands his troops as they wage war across the smoldering and stinking planes of the Abyss. Orcus spends most of his days in his palace, rarely leaving its confines unless he decides to leads his troops into battle (which has happened on more than one occasion). Most of the time though, he is content to let his generals and commanders lead the battles.

Orcus is a squat, bloated humanoid standing 15 feet tall and weighing 3 tons. His goat-like head sports large, spiraling ram-like horns and his legs are covered in thick brown fur and end in hooves. Two large, black, bat-like wings protrude from its back and a long, snake-like tail, tipped with a sharpened barb, trails behind it.

When not warring against rival demon princes, Orcus likes to travel the planes, particularly the Material Plane. Should a foolish spellcaster open a gate and speak his name, he is more than likely going to hear the call and step through to the Material Plane. What happens to the spellcaster that called him usually depends on the reason for the summons and the power of the spellcaster. Extremely powerful spellcasters are usually slain after a while and turned into undead soldiers or generals in his armies.

Orcus prefers to fight using his wand. His tail sting delivers a virulent poison (save or die).

Orcus can command or banish undead as a 15th-level cleric, controlling up to 150 HD worth of undead at one time. He casts spells as a 15th level cleric and 12th level magic-user, and can use the following magical abilities at will: *animate dead, charm monster, darkness, dispel magic, ESP, fear, feeblemind* (1/day), *lightning bolt, speak with dead, symbol* (any) and *wall of fire.*

Orcus radiates a 60-foot-radius aura of fear (as the spell). A creature in the area must succeed on a DC 44 Will save or be affected as though by a fear spell (caster level 35th). A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by Orcus’s fear aura for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Three times per day, Orcus can summon one balor, 1d3 nalfeshnees or 1d4 mariliths. As their prince, Orcus can summon up to 100 HD of any type of undead each day.

***Wand of Orcus***: Mighty Orcus wields a huge black skull-tipped rod that functions as a *+3 heavy mace*. It slays any living creature it touches if the target fails a saving throw. Orcus can shut this ability off so as to allow his wand to pass into the Material Plane, usually into the hands of one of his servants. Further, the *Wand* has the following magical powers: 3/day—*animate dead, darkness* and *fear*; 2/day—*unholy word*.

#### Servants of Orcus

The followers of the Prince of Undead are clerics that venerate death, magic-users fascinated with death, and cambions and alu-demons. His followers are most often clerics and necromancers. Clerics of Orcus are known as Disciples of Orcus and must sign a pact of evil. Disciples of Orcus can receive spells up to 3rd level from Orcus.

- Orcus (Demon Prince of the Undead): **HD** 30 (120 hp); **AC** -5 \[24\]; **Atk** *Wand of Orcus* (2d6 or death) or 2 fists (3d6) and tail sting (2d6 plus poison); **Move** 18/24 (flying); **Save** 3; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 40/10400; **Special**: Command undead, spells, summon undead, +3 or better weapon to hit, immunity to electricity and poison, speak with dead, magic resistance (75%), telepathy 100 ft.

#### Demon Lord, Pazuzu (Demon Prince of Air)

Pazuzu is the demon prince of aerial creatures, and is revered as such on both the Abyssal plane and the Material Plane. Unlike other demon princes, his lair is not confined to a single plane or multiple adjoining planes; Pazuzu rules the sky realms above all layers of the Abyss. (No demon prince has contested his rulership of the skies thus far.) Pazuzu appears as a muscular human being with the head of a hawk and four great, feathery wings spanning its shoulders. His feathers are red and gold, fading to black at the tip and his eyes are red. Pazuzu’s heads and feet end in talons.

Pazuzu has three breath weapons. Regardless of which breath weapon he uses, he can’t breathe more than once every 1d4 rounds. Each breath weapon is a 100-foot long cone. The first works like the *creeping doom* spell, the second like the *insect plague* spell and the last is a corrosive gas that deals 10d6 points of acid damage (saving throw for half damage) and ruins leather equipment, including armor.

Three times per day, Pazuzu can automatically summon 2d6 harpies, 2d8 gargoyles or 1d4 hieracosphinxes with a 50% chance of success. Pazuzu can automatically dominate any aerial creature of 6 HD or less that is within sight, no saving throw allowed. This functions as a charm monster spell. At any one time, Pazuzu can have a total of 20 HD of creatures dominated. Affected creatures must remain with sight or the effect ends. Aerial creatures are defined as avians, gargoyles, harpies, and elemental air creatures. No aerial creature of 10 HD or less willingly attacks Pazuzu, but they can be forced to magically.

Pazuzu can cast spells as a 12th level magic-user. He can use the following magical abilities: *Control weather, darkness, dispel magic,* *flesh to stone, lightning bolt, shape change, wind walk* and, once per day, *wish*.

#### Servants of Pazuzu

Followers of Pazuzu are chaotic humanoids that respect and revere the air and sky. Clerics of Pazuzu are called Aerial Lords and must sign a pact of evil with Pazuzu. Aerial Lords can receive up to 3rd level spells from Pazuzu.

- Pazuzu (Demon Prince of Air): **HD** 20 (110 hp); **AC** -2 \[21\]; **Atk** *+2 sword* (2d6+2), 2 claws (1d10); **Move** 15/30 (flying); **Save** 3; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 30/7400; **Special**: Breath weapon, dominate and summon aerial creatures, spells, aerial passivism, +2 or better weapon to hit, immunity to electricity and poison, magic resistance (70%), telepathy 100 ft.

#### Demon Lord, Sonechard (General of Orcus)

Sonechard is a ram-headed demon standing 14 feet tall. He has gray, leathery skin, large, curved horns (half of the left horn broken off) and two large, bat-like wings. Sonechard’s body is covered in thick, dark hair. Portions of the hair are torn away in areas revealing masses of battle-born scars and damage. Sonechard is a general in the infernal armies of Orcus and serves him—at least to all onlookers—with unswerving loyalty. He has countless numbers of demons and undead at his command. Though his true loyalty lies only to himself, he would never openly refuse a request by Orcus nor challenge his position as Prince of the Undead. Should the day come when Orcus weakens, Sonechard plans to be there to claim what he believes is rightfully his. Sonechard makes his home in a large castle that sits atop a plateau of scorched earth surrounded by a moat of blood. The walls are constructed of bone and sinew, and it is said that the souls of those who cross him are entombed within.

Sonechard’s form secretes a nauseating odor that emanates from him to a range of 20 feet. All living creatures within this range must succeed on a saving throw or be nauseated, suffering a –1 penalty to hit for 1 hour. A *neutralize poison* spell removes the nausea.

Once per day, Sonechard can automatically summon 4d10 zombies or skeletons, 2d8 shadows, wights, or wraiths, 2d4 greater shadows or spectres, or 1d4 dread wraiths. He can create up to 50 HD of undead creatures with the *animate dead* spell and can control undead as a 20th level chaotic cleric.

Sonechard can cast the following spells: *Animate dead, fireball* (3/day), *power word stun, suggestion* and *wall of fire.*

Sonechard’s *+2 military pick* deals an extra 1d3 points from blood loss when it hits a creature. This damage is inflicted every round thereafter until the wound is bound or magically healed.

- Sonechard (General of Orcus): **HD** 18; **AC** -2 \[21\]; **Atk** *+2 military* pick (1d8+2) or 2 claws (1d10); **Move** 15/30 (flying); **Save** 3; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 27/6500; **Special**: Control undead, spells, stench, summon undead, +1 or better weapon to hit, immunity to electricity and poison, magic resistance (60%), telepathy 100 ft.

#### Demon Lord, Tsathogga (The Frog God)

Tsathogga is a gigantic frog no less than 60 feet long with spindly, elongated limbs and fingers. His body is covered in warts and sores and all ooze a putrid, yellowish mucus. His eyes are red and glow with an inherent evil and his massive mouth sports rows of sharpened teeth, each at least as long as a sword. Tsathogga cares less about the machinations of men and power than he does about obliterating light and life with the slow oozing sickness and decay that he represents. He is the viscous dark evil bubbling up from beneath the surface, the foul corruption at the heart of the earth. Tsathogga makes his home on both Tarterus and the Abyss, spending equal amounts of time in both places. His lair is a vast swamp of filth deposited by the River Styx as it flows between the two planes. Tsathogga thoughtlessly commands a host of evil creatures, notably his own vile frog race, the tsathar (see that entry in this book).

Tsathogga’s demonic form constantly oozes and drips acid, causing opponents to take an extra 1d8 points of acid damage every time he succeeds on a bite, claw, or tongue attack. Creatures attacking Tsathogga unarmed take this same acid damage each time one of their attacks hits. Any weapon striking Tsathogga’s acidic body must succeed at a saving throw or suffer a cumulative -1 penalty to damage - a weapon that has its potential damage reduced to 0 is destroyed.

Creatures struck by Tsathogga’s tongue suffer 1d8 points of acid damage and must succeed at a saving throw or be swallowed whole and consumed.

Three times per day, Tsathogga can unleash a piercing shriek that affects all non-chaotic creatures within a 100-foot radius as if by an un-holy word (reverse of holy word). Tsathogga can billow forth a cloud of thick, dark fog from his skin. This fog spreads to fill a 50-foot radius, 50 feet high. The darkness generated by the cloud nullifies normal lights (torches, candles, lanterns, and so forth) within the area. Light spells of 5th level or lower are incapable of brightening the area. This cloud remains for 10 minutes before dispersing. Tsathogga cannot use this ability underwater.

Tsathogga can cast spells as a 15th level magic-user. He can also use the following magical abilities: *Acid cone* (as *cone of cold*, but deals acid damage), *darkness, dispel magic, ESP, polymorph self* and *water* *breathing*. He can summon up to 30 HD of oozes, tsathar, giant frogs, or froghemoths each day.

#### Servants of Tsathogga

Followers of Tsathogga are the tsathar and some few evil and vile humans or giants. He has few other worshippers, though it is rumored that an evil cult of sahuagin worships him on the Material Plane. Clerics of Tsathogga are called Lords of the Gaping Maw and must sign a pact of evil with Tsathogga. Lords of the Gaping Maw receive up to 3rd level spells from Tsathogga.

- Tsathogga (The Frog God): **HD** 5 (130 hp); **AC** -4 \[23\]; **Atk** Bite (3d6) or tongue (see below); **Move** 15; **Save** 3; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 34/8600; **Special**: Blasphemous shriek, swallow whole, spells, +3 or better weapon to hit, immune to acid and poison, magic resistance (80%), telepathy 100 ft.

#### Demon Lord, Vepar (Duke of Dagon)

Vepar is an Abyssal duke who resembles a 12-foot-tall merman. His upper torso is coppery-brown while his lower torso and fins are silver and scaled. Vepar’s hair is long and black, and he usually wears it tied back or braided. His eyes, usually blue in color, burn with a silvery fire when he is angered or excited. Under his hair, two small copper horns can be seen just above his eyes. Vepar’s hands end in wicked claws with silvery nails. At will, Vepar can *control winds, detect good,* *cause fear, dispel* *magic, teleport* and *polymorph self.* Once per day he can create an ice storm. Vepar wields his trident – named Demonbrand – which can fire up to seven *magic missiles* per day for 1d4+1 points of damage each. Anyone hit by Vepar’s claws must save or be overcome by bone-numbing cold that does 1d8 points of damage (save for half). He is immune to electricity and poison, and takes half damage from cold, fire and acid.

- Vepar (Duke of Dagon): **HD** 22; **AC** -4 \[23\]; **Atk** *+2 trident (Demonbrand)* (2d6+4) or 2 claws (1d8+2 + hypothermic touch); **Move** 6/24 (swim); **Save** 3; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 34/8600; **Special**: Magical abilities, hypothermic touch, summon demons, +2 magic weapons to hit

#### Demon Prince, Isclaadra (Demon-Prince of Mists)

Isclaadra is a tall, human-like figure with the horns and legs of a goat, and massive bat wings. He is one of the weakest of the demon princes, and he is uncharacteristically subtle when compared to his peers. He has the spell-casting ability of an 8<sup>th</sup> level magic-user in addition to the powers described below, and can only be hit by weapons of +2 or greater.

At will, Isclaadra can cast *charm monster, clairvoyance, continual darkness, dispel magic, ESP, fear, read languages, read magic, telekinesis* (1,000 pounds of weight), and *suggestion*.

Isclaadra’s Staff of Mist is a powerful magic artifact, allowing the holder to enter gaseous form at will, and capable of summoning forth one of three types of mist (each once per day):

*Mist of Magic Absorption:* this mist can be streamed forth from the staff up to a distance of 100ft before it expands. Once it blossoms into a cloud, it eats magic in an area 50 ft. in diameter, temporarily removing all bonuses or other effects from magic items while they are in the mist. The power of the mist does not extend to powerful artifacts, but is enough to suppress magical swords, armor, and miscellaneous items. Spells cannot be cast within the mist, but the effects of a spell that has already been cast (e.g. *invisibility* or *haste*) are unaffected by the mist, and potions will also take effect if imbibed in the mist. The holder of the staff can cause the mist to creep in any direction, but it has a move of only 10ft. Its duration is 5d6 turns

*Mist of Confusion:* the range, size, move, and duration of the Mist of Confusion are all identical to those of the Mist of Magic Absorption. Its effect is that of a *confusion* spell.

*Mist of Striking:* The Mist of Striking is a thin ribbon of vapor that extends from the staff up to a length of 100ft. It can attack once per round as a 30HD monster, inflicting 2d6 points of damage. Other than by *dispel magic* against a 12th level caster, the Mist of Striking cannot be killed, although it will disappear after 5d6 turns.

- Demon Prince Isclaadra: **HD** 22 (110 hp); **AC** -6 \[25\]; **Atk** 1 staff (6d6) or 2 claws (2d6); **Move** 12 (Fly 12); **Save** 3; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 30/7400; **Special**: Magic resistance (90%), +2 magic weapon required to hit, spells, staff of mist, magical abilities.

#### Demon Prince, Kharkazax (Demon-Prince of Carrion)

Kharkazax resembles a humanoid jackal with the wings and head of a vulture, and he is always accompanied by 6 vrock-type demons of maximum hit points. This demon-lord is known as the Prince of Carrion, for his followers are scavengers and carrion-eaters of all kinds, including, unpleasantly, his human cultists. Although he is brilliant and subtle, Kharkazax is more feral in combat than most demon princes; if he is forced into melee combat he will tear into his foes with beak and claws rather than using weapons. Any creature other than a demon coming within 50ft of him will be affected by his smell, as if by a *slow* spell (no saving throw). His bite is diseased, causing death within 1d4+1 rounds if the rapid course of the disease is not checked (if a saving throw succeeds, the disease merely causes 1d4 points of damage each round, for 1d4+1 rounds, but does not kill).

At will, Kharkazax can cast *charm monster, clairvoyance, continual darkness, dispel magic, ESP, fear, read languages, read magic, telekinesis* (1,000 pounds of weight), and *suggestion*. Once per day, Kharkazax can create a wall of vermin, a mass of roaches and centipedes that rises 40 ft. in height and 100 ft. in length, or forms a covered dome thirty feet across and twenty feet in height. The biting creatures in the wall automatically inflict 2d10+20 points of damage against anyone breaking through it, and 1d10 hit points per round against anyone trying to attack it with a melee weapon. The wall is armor class 8, and has 100 hit points. Kharkazax can see through the eyes of his wall-vermin, and cast spells from the wall as if he were standing within it, but for all others the wall blocks vision and cannot be penetrated by spells. Demons take no damage from passing through the wall unless Kharkazax so desires.

This demon-prince cannot be damaged by weapons of less than +3 enchantment. *(Author: Matt Finch)*

- Demon Prince Kharkazax: **HD** 30 (120 hp); **AC** -6 \[25\]; **Atk** 2 claws (2d8) and 1 bite (4d8); **Move** 9 (Fly 12); **Save** 3; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 38/9800; **Special**: Magic resistance (70%), +3 magic weapon required to hit, magical abilities.

#### Demon Prince, Orcus (Demon-Prince of the Undead)

Orcus is one of the strongest (if not the strongest) and most powerful of all demon lords. Known as the Prince of the Undead, he fights a never-ending war against rival demon princes that spans several Abyssal layers. From his great bone palace he commands his troops as they wage war across the smoldering and stinking planes of the Abyss. Orcus spends most of his days in his palace, rarely leaving its confines unless he decides to leads his troops into battle (which has happened on more than one occasion). Most of the time though, he is content to let his generals and commanders lead the battles.

Orcus is a squat, bloated humanoid standing 15 feet tall and weighing 3 tons. His goat-like head sports large, spiraling ram-like horns and his legs are covered in thick brown fur and end in hooves. Two large, black, batlike wings protrude from his back and a long, snake-like tail, tipped with a sharpened barb, trails behind it.

When not warring against rival demon princes, Orcus likes to travel the planes, particularly the Material Plane. Should a foolish spellcaster open a *gate* and speak his name, he is more than likely going to hear the call and step through to the Material Plane. What happens to the spellcaster that called him usually depends on the reason for the summons and the power of the spellcaster. Extremely powerful spellcasters are usually slain after a while and turned into undead soldiers or generals in the demon lord’s armies.

**Combat**

Orcus prefers to fight using his *Wand*. His tail sting delivers a virulent poison (save or die). Orcus can command or banish undead as a 15th-level cleric, controlling up to 150 HD worth of undead at one time. He casts spells as a 15th level Cleric and 12th level Magic-user, and can use the following magical abilities at will: *animate dead, charm monster, darkness, dispel magic, ESP, fear, feeblemind* (1/day), *lightning bolt, speak with dead, symbol (any)* and *wall of fire*.

Orcus radiates a 60-foot-radius aura of fear (as the spell). A creature in the area must succeed at a saving throw or be affected as though by a fear spell.

Three times per day, Orcus can summon one balor, 1d3 nalfeshnees or 1d4 mariliths. As their prince, Orcus can summon up to 100 HD of any type of undead each day.

*Wand of Orcus*: Mighty Orcus wields a huge, black, skull-tipped rod that functions as a *+3 heavy mace*. It slays any living creature it touches if the target fails a saving throw. Further, the *Wand* has the following magical powers: 3/day—*animate dead, darkness and fear*; 2/day—*unholy word*. Orcus occasionally allows his wand to pass into the Material Plane, usually into the hands of one of his servants.

- Orcus: **HD** 30 (125 hp); **AC** -6 \[25\]; **Atk** Wand of Orcus (2d6 or death) or 2 fists (3d6) and tail sting (2d6 plus poison); **Move** 18 (Fly 24); **Save** 3; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 40/10400; **Special**: Command undead, spells, summon undead, +3 or better weapon to hit, immunity to electricity and poison, speak with dead, magic resistance (75%), telepathy 100 ft.

#### Demon Princess, Teratashia (Demon-Princess of Dimensions)

The Demon-Princess Teratashia’s dark palace in the depths of the Abyss is a nexus of countless gaps between dimensions, a warren of tunnels worming their way deep into a multitude of other realities. From the center of this web of connections, Teratashia sends her minions creeping and slithering through the planes of existence to do her bidding. Her darkswimmer demons (q.v.) are but one of the many types of servitors employed by this horrid creature.

Teratashia resembles a huge, female-headed cockroach with a feral visage, wearing a necklace of human skulls. This necklace is a powerful artifact (see, “The Necklace of Skulls,” below). She is often known as the Mistress of Dimensions, and her servants include many demons and other creatures that hunt and hide in the dark non-places between the true planes of existence.

At will, Teratashia can cast *charm monster, clairvoyance, continual darkness, dimension door, dispel magic, ESP, insect swarm* (3/day), *fear, read languages, read magic, telekinesis* (1,000 pounds of weight), *teleport*, *suggestion,* and *wall of stone*. In darkness, she regenerates 2 hit points per round, and in the light she moves with preternatural speed, her armor class improving to -8. Only weapons with an enchantment of +2 or more can damage her.

Teratashia’s Necklace of Skulls has 25 charges, and recharges itself within 25 hours (one charge per hour). Each round (until the charges are expended) the necklace can perform one of the following actions in addition to Teratashia’s other abilities).

*Cone of Cold* (3 charges)
*Cure* the wearer of 2d8 hit points of damage (2 charges)
*Darkness* 30-ft. radius (1 charge)
*Death* spell (5 charges)
*Fireball* (2 charges)
*Knock* (1 charge)
*Wizard lock* (1 charge)

Teratashia seldom involves herself in the quarrels of the other great demons, being far more interested in controlling the nooks and crannies between dimensions than with her political status in the Abyss.

- Demon Princess Teratashia: **HD** 25 (130 hp); **AC** -6 \[25\] or -8 \[27\]; **Atk** 4 claws (2d6); **Move** 12 (Fly 24); **Save** 3; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 42/11000; **Special**: Magic resistance (85%), +2 or better weapon to hit, regeneration in darkness, improved AC (speed) in light, necklace of skulls, demonic powers.

#### Demon Prince, Thalasskoptis (The Sea-Demon Lord)

Thalasskoptis is a mass of writhing tentacles with a feral, boyish face in the center. It is a powerful demon-prince that makes its lair in the deep, dark seas of the Abyss, living in a sprawling palace of coral that dives into deep subterranean tunnels beneath the sea floor. Thalasskoptis is the lord of underwater corruption, the sea-dead, and many horrific beasts of the dark, oceanic deeps. It is an occasional rival with Orcus, given that its rulership of the sea-undead conflicts with the broader claims of the other demon-prince, but the two demons are similar enough that they are allies more frequently than enemies in the grim power struggles of the Abyssal realms. Some rivals of Thalasskoptis even dismiss it as the underwater minion of Orcus, a claim which is likely to incur a terrible vengeance from the sea-demon.

Beyond the realms of the Abyss, Thalasskoptis has scattered followings of human cultists, predominantly in coastal communities, and in the deeps he is served by dark tritons (q.v.). From time to time, his dark ships of drowned, undead sailors will rise from the waters to pillage treasure for their dread lord; one reason why his human cults are not attacked or driven off is the potential for reprisal by these ships. When the black fleets rise from the water, reeking of salt and rot, miles of coastline can be purged of life by hordes of Thalasskoptis’s dead men, the inhabitants dragged down beneath the waves to serve the master they dismissed with insufficient fear.

At will, Thalasskoptis can cast *animate dead*, *charm monster, clairvoyance, continual darkness, dispel magic, ESP, fear, read languages, read magic, telekinesis* (1,000 pounds of weight), *teleport*, *suggestion,* and *wall of stone*. Three times per day, the demon-prince can also squirt a vast cloud of poisonous ink into the air or water, with twice the dimensions of a fireball. Anyone in the area of the cloud must make a saving throw against this poison or die. Anyone looking directly at the demon must also make a saving throw each round or become entranced for 1d4+3 melee rounds, unable to take any actions until the fascination has ended. Thalasskoptis cannot be damaged by any weapon with less than a +3 enchantment. *(Author: Matt Finch)*

- Demon Prince Thalasskoptis: **HD** 30 (125 hp); **AC** -6 \[25\]; **Atk** 8 tentacles (2d8); **Move** 12(Swim 24); **Save** 3; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 39/10100; **Special**: Magic resistance (90%), +3 or better weapon to hit, poison ink, gaze attack, demonic powers.

#### Demon Prince, Yildraathu (Demon-Lord of Pestilence)

Yildraathu is a large, bubbling pool of viscous ichor, with tentacles constantly emerging from and sucking back into the horrid mass of the demon-lord’s “body.”

At will, Yildraathu can cast *charm monster, clairvoyance, continual darkness, dispel magic, ESP, fear, read languages, read magic, telekinesis* (1,000 pounds of weight), and *suggestion*.

If Yildaathu hits an opponent, the opponent must succeed in a saving throw or be afflicted by a disease. This disease, Yildaathu’s Plague, immediately causes the loss of 1d6 hit points in addition to the damage caused by the tentacle itself, and the disease may cause death within 3 rounds (a second saving throw is allowed to avoid death). Even if the victim survives, if a cure disease spell is not used to prevent further infection then death will result in 1d4+3 days. A character who has been hit by a tentacle and succeeds with the initial saving throw is not immune to the disease, but each time that a saving throw is made against the disease a bonus of +1 (cumulative) is gained on saving throws made against infection or death from infection.

Three times per day, Yildraathu can breathe forth a cone-shaped blast of pestilence 100ft long and expanding to 60 ft. in width. Anything in this cloud must make as saving throw against the poisonous breath or suffer the loss of 6d6 hit points of damage, in addition to paralysis for 3 rounds. Success on the saving throw indicates that only half damage is taken and that the paralysis is avoided.

Yildraathu can only be damaged by weapons with an enchantment of +2 or greater.

The yildra demons (q.v.) are particularly associated with Yildraathu, and are summoned from time to time by Yildraathic cults, but the demon-lord is also served by a number of other demon types.*(Author: Matt Finch)*

- Demon Prince Yildraathy: **HD** 32 (160 hp); **AC** -7 \[26\]; **Atk** 1d6+4 tentacles (1d8+1+disease); **Move** 6; **Save** 3; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 40/10400; **Special**: Magic resistance (60%), +2 weapon to hit, disease, pestilential breath weapon, demonic and magical powers.

### Demon-Stirge

Demon-stirges are the result of magical experimentations with infusing demonic ichor into the bodies of stirges, then breeding the tainted creatures. The result of these experiments, often attributed to the mage Sacavious of the Black Monastery, is a diseased creature more durable and cunning than a natural stirge. A demon-stirge can cast darkness 15-ft. radius once per day, and there is a 10% chance that with a successful hit, it will infect the character with a disease that will be fatal in 1d4+7 days.

Like a normal stirge, demon-stirges have a proboscis which they jab into their prey to drain blood. After a stirge’s first hit, it drains blood automatically at a rate of 1d6 hit points per round. The faster rate of blood-draining is due to barbs and ridges on the proboscis; pulling a dead demon-stirge out of a wound will inflict one last hit point of damage simply from ripping out the barbed tube.

- Demon-Stirge: **HD** 3; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 2 horns (1d4); **Move** 9; **Save** 14; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 7/600; **Special**: Magic resistance (30%), Immune to blunt damage, fire and poison.

### Demon-Wolf of Braazz

The demon-wolves of Braazz are creatures from another plane of existence than can be summoned forth by use of forbidden tomes and sorcerous rituals. In their normal shape, they resemble grey-skinned demons with hideous wolf-like faces and the legs and tail of a wolf (the rest of the body being gaunt but human). They are also, however, shape-changers, and can take on the appearance of wolves with twisted human faces.

The Wolves of Braazz can only be hit by a magic weapon, although they do not have any magic resistance to spells. They have certain other supernatural abilities as well: they can blink once per day (teleporting to a random location within 30ft, usually just after attacking or after becoming invisible), they can turn invisible three times per day at will, and they can charm any creature meeting their gaze (although they can maintain this charm over only one creature at a time). (*Originally published in The Black Monastery, by Frog God Games, adapted to Swords & Wizardry by Matt Finch)*

- Demon-Wolf of Braaz: **HD** 5; **AC** 1 \[18\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d10); **Move** 15; **Save** 12; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: Blink, invisibility, charm, magic weapon required to hit.

### Demonic Knight

The demonic knight—known by some as a death knight—is rumored to be the creation of the great demon prince Orcus, the Prince of the Undead. Some sages doubt the validity of such a claim, since the demonic knights are not undead. Though no link has been proven, however, it is known that three of the most powerful demonic knights (Baruliis, Caines, and Arrunes) make their home in the shadow of Orcus’s great citadel. The demonic knights serve their master (whoever it may be) with unswerving loyalty. They never question their orders or station. They are often sent to the Material Plane to recruit new bodies for their master’s next plot or deception, or to punish those that have offended their lord. On some occasions, they are simply sent to another plane to corrupt and slay those that are just and good (to the delight of their master). It is unknown exactly how many demonic knights exist, but they are believed to number no more than nine. Demonic knights appear as humanoids in black, gothic plate armor. They are armed with *+1 longswords*.

Those within sound of the demonic knight’s voice must pass a saving throw or flee in terror for 2d4 rounds. Three times per day, a demonic knight can exhale a blast of negative energy in a 10-foot cone. Creatures in the area of the cone must pass a saving throw or suffer 2d4 points of Strength damage. Strength returns at the rate of 1 point per day. Creatures reduced to a strength score of 0 are killed, rising as shadow demons in 2d4 rounds. The shadow demons are slaves to the demonic knight until it is destroyed.

Demonic knights can cast the following spells: *dispel magic* (2/day), *fireball* (1/day), *symbol of fear* (1/day) and *wall of ice.* They are capable of seeing through invisibility and illusions.

- Demonic Knight: **HD** 9; **AC** -1 \[20\]; **Atk** *+1 longsword* (1d8+1) or 2 slams (1d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 6; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 14/2600; **Special**: Breath of unlife, fear, magic resistance (30%), +1 or better weapon to hit, spells, summon demons

### Demonvessel

A demonvessel is a corpse that has been animated by trapping the essence of a demon within the body rather than relying on the more basic necromantic means of animating corpses. Depending upon the exact method used to bind the demon into a dead corpse, these undead creatures usually resemble mummies, but in some cases they will appear to be zombies with strange runes tattooed into the skin. These undead do not have any particularly unusual attacks, but their minor magic resistance, immunity to normal weapons, and demonic immunities (see below) make them dangerous opponents, particularly when they are commanding numbers of lesser undead. A demonvessel is turned as a vampire, and is affected by *protection from evil* spells.

Demonvessels take only half damage from lightning, fire, and cold, and they are unaffected by charm and sleep magic. They have the ability to take permanent control of any non-intelligent undead within speaking distance, and can charm ghouls (although the ghoul would be allowed a saving throw). For this reason, demonvessels are often found leading packs or even small hordes of such lesser undead. Demonvessels are no more intelligent than the demon imprisoned within, so there is a certain amount of variation: many are little more intelligent than ghouls, but some of them are quite crafty and subtle, capable of long range planning and unexpectedly devious thinking.

Most demonvessels will be encountered with a band of 2d4 skeletons, 2d4 zombies, 1d6 ghouls, and 1d2-1 ghasts. These undead are all turned as vampires while under the command of the demonvessel. (*Author: Matt Finch)*

- Demonvessel: **HD** 6; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d8); **Move** 12; **Save** 11; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 9/1100; **Special**: Magic resistance 10%, +1 or better weapon to hit, immunities.

### Denizen of Leng

The eerie Men of Leng travel the universe from their strange homeland, always disguising themselves as humans in loose-fitting robes, with wrappings about the head and face. They are the same size as humans, but under their disguises they have horned brows, clawed fingers, mouths full of tentacles, and crooked goatish legs with cloven hooves. Many scholars have argued over where the otherworldly realm of Leng lies—some believe it can be found among the Outer Planes, while others are convinced it can only be reached via a dimension of dreams. The denizens of Leng can travel to other planes freely, and often do so in strange, black ships, constantly seeking new breeds of slaves or trading rubies for unusual services or magical treasures. At other times, their visits are much more violent, focusing on abducting victims for use as slaves or worse. On Leng, these denizens have long fought a war against that realm’s monstrous spiders, a war that sometimes spills over into other worlds.

A Leng denizen’s bite causes lassitude if the victim fails a saving throw (at -2). Any attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws are made at -2 thereafter until the victim has slept continuously for 12 hours. If the same victim is bitten (and fails the saving throw) a second time, the victim immediately falls into deep slumber and cannot be awakened for 12 hours. Additionally, a denizen of Leng is constantly able to read the thoughts of nearby creatures (ESP) and once per day can cast a *mirror image* of itself.

The denizens of Leng regenerate naturally if they are not on Leng, at a rate of 5hp per round. The process cannot be arrested by fire as it can, for example, with trolls. However, once a denizen reaches 0 hit points, the body dissolves into slime (and re-forms on Leng). On Leng itself, denizens do not regenerate, and die completely. Not having souls, they cannot be raised from the dead.(*Author: Adapted by Matt Finch)*

- Denizen of Leng: **HD** 8; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d3 + lassitude), 2 claws (1d4+1); **Move** 12; **Save** 8; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 13/2300; **Special**: regeneration (5hp), lassitude, immune to poison, mirror image, constant ESP.

### Dergenue (Wall Wench)

When dungeons and dark temples have bas-reliefs of half-naked women carved into their walls, adventurers should be aware that some of these provocative decorations may be Dergenue, a race of intelligent, mischievous earth elementals. They hide in walls, using their innate ability to phase through earth and stone, and attack by reaching out to grab at unwary passersby (high chance to surprise). Their blows cause 1d6 damage, and they may drag their victims into the wall (to swiftly suffocate and die) if the attack roll succeeds by 4 or more points. Earth-based magic may cause 1d8 damage per spell level to a dergenue, or slay her outright, depending upon the spell. A dergenue takes normal damage from fire, cold, and weapons, but is otherwise immune to almost all other attack forms. If she steps out of a wall, a dergenue must remain in contact with earth or stone or lose 1 HP per turn, and they cannot cross a barrier of fire or water. *(Author: Scott Wylie Roberts, "Myrystyr").*

- Dergenue: **HD** 2; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 1 strike (1d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 16; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**: Drag into stone, immunities.

### Dertesha

The Dertesha are a race of aquatic humanoids dwelling in rivers and lakes. They appear tall, thin, and human-like, but with long tentacles in place of legs. Some are a mottled greenish-blue in colour, and others are reddish-brown; a few have been reported yellowish-white. Dertesha are able to travel above water – on land and through the air – by magical watery spheres, oily and roiling in appearance. The dertesha are slightly translucent, and their bones are sometimes visible.
Dertesha disdain physical conflict, being haughty and convinced of their moral and intellectual superiority over the land-dwelling races. They can cause large tentacles to erupt from any surface within 60ft, one per round, which restrain any target they strike (saving throw if hit negates). They may also cast Magic Missile at will. If pressed into close combat, their touch acts as a paralytic poison that can have hallucinatory after-effects. They may also simply drag air-breathing opponents under the water and hold them there to drown.

Dertesha have a sophisticated culture unseen by land-dwelling races, and they communicate frequently with creatures of elemental air and water. *(Author: Scott Wylie Roberts, "Myrystyr").*

- [Dertesha](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Dertesha): **HD** 6; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 1 (special); **Move** 12 (swim or fly 12); **Save** 11; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 9/1100; **Special**: create tentacles, magic missile, paralysis touch.

### Dhezik

Dheziks look rather like dwarves with green skin and yellow eyes. However, they are feral, naked savages who paint swirls on their bodies with the blood of their foes. Their long white hair, eyebrows and moustaches are prehensile, enabling the Dhezik to entangle an opponent in close combat (saving throw to avoid), then bite the beard-entwined opponents with their prominent canine fangs. After a fresh kill there is a 1 in 6 chance their bloodlust may cause them to attack each other. Dheziks are completely resistant to arcane magic directed at them, due to strange glyphs branded on their shoulders. They are of low intelligence, are infertile, have a pack mentality, and will viciously attack Dwarves (+1 to hit). *(Author Sean Wills).*

- Dhezik: **HD** 4; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 13; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Entangle, Immune to Arcane Magic.

### Devils

Demons are creatures of the lower planes of existence, but they are occasionally encountered in places where they have been enslaved to serve as guardians by powerful magic-users or evil priests. The more intelligent varieties might also be interrupted while carrying out plots of their own. *Swords & Wizardry* makes no game distinction between demons and devils, for the convenience of those using only a three-alignment system; all are simply creatures of the lower planes, to be used as desired with the Referee’s own campaign.

#### Devil, Amaimon

Amaimons stand nearly 10 feet tall, weigh about 700 pounds and look like bloated, squat humanoids with scarlet flesh. They have a long, curved and forked tail, clawed hands and feet, and round, squashed heads with two small horns just above their sapphire colored eyes. Amiamons can breathe a cloud of poisonous fire that deals 3d8 points of damage. A saving throw halves the damage. Amaimons radiate fear in a 10-foot radius. At will, Amaimons can *teleport*, create a *phantasmal force* and cast *wall of fire*. Amaimons can use *ESP* at will.

- Devil, Amaimon **HD** 7; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d6), 1 bite (1d8); **Move** 12; **Save** 9; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**: breath weapon, magic resistance (15%), immune to fire, fear aura, spell-like abilities

#### Devil, Blood Reaver (Garugin)

Blood reavers, also known as garugins, are 7-foot-tall bipedal humanoids with reddish-bronze leathery flesh and gleaming, gold eyes. Its hands end in blood-stained claws and the smell of fresh blood always hangs in the air around a blood reaver. Its fearsome visage sports a slightly curved mouth laced with sharp, flesh-rending fangs. The blood reaver has a long, forked tail the same color as its body. Blood reavers radiate an aura in a 20-foot radius that causes creatures to bleed from their mouths, noses, eyes and ears. Affected creatures must save or lose 1d6 hit points each round. When a blood reaver hits with its barbed flail, the opponent must save or be stunned for 1 round. At will a blood reaver can *teleport*, *turn* *invisible* and create a *wall of fire*. Once per day it can create a *lightning* *bolt*. Blood reavers are immune to fire and poison, and take half damage from cold and acid.

- Devil, Blood Reaver (Garugin) **HD** 9; **AC** 1 \[18\]; **Atk** dual-headed barbed flail (1d10+3 + stun) or 2
    claws (2d6+3); **Move** 12; **Save** 6; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 13/2300; **Special**: Siphoning aura, magical abilities, summon devils, +1 weapons to hit, regenerates 5 hp/round

#### Devil, Flayer (Marzach)

A flayer demon is a 13-foot-tall hulking brute with leathery, crimson skin, a large mouth lined with razor-sharp teeth, and large, round horns protruding from the sides of its hairless head. Its hands and feet end in large, sharpened claws and its eyes are bronze-colored and slitted. A flayer devil that rolls a natural 20 with its claw attack rips the flesh from its opponent’s body, dealing 2d6 points of damage. At will, a flayer can *detect good* and *teleport*. Once per day, it can cast *wall of fire.* Three times per day, the flayer devil can unleash a burst of hellish black vapor in a 30-foot radius that sickens anyone in the area for 1d6 rounds (save resists). Lawful creatures take 3d6 points of damage from this unholy aura if they fail their save. Flayers are immune to fire and poison, and take half damage from cold and acid.

- Devil, Flayer (Marzach) **HD** 12; **AC** -1 \[20\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d6+3) and bite (1d8+3); **Move** 12; **Save** 3; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 18/3800; **Special**: Flensing, magical abilities, summon devils, unholy burst, +1 magic weapons to hit, regenerate 5 hp/round, magic resistance (24%), immune to fire and poison, resists cold and acid

#### Devil, Ghaddar

The terrible and mighty ghaddars roam the planes of Hell devouring the unfortunate souls of those they encounter. They also consume the essence and being of any outcast devils and dukes that cross their path. A typical ghaddar stands 15 feet tall and has the head of a donkey with large, downward-curving horns. A ghaddar’s eyes are stark white, with hollow, black pupils. Its feet are splayed and it shuffles with a hunched gait.

If a ghaddar scores a natural “20” on its attack roll and its foe fails a saving throw, it severs the foe’s head. When a ghaddar slays a humanoid, spending a minute to devour both flesh and life force. Feeding destroys the victim’s body and prevents any form of raising and resurrection. For every three suitable corpses a ghaddar devours, it gains 1 Hit Die and its Armor Class increases by +1. The ghaddar only advances by consuming the corpses of creatures whose Hit Dice or levels are equal to or greater than its own current total.

Ghaddars can use the following spells: *Fireball* (3/day), *phantasmal* *force* and *wall of fire.*

- Devil, Ghaddar **HD** 16; **AC** -2 \[21\]; **Atk** 2 claws (2d8) and bite (2d6); **Move** 15; **Save** 3; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 23/5300; **Special**: Feed, spells, vorpal bite, +1 or better weapon to hit, immunity to fire and poison, see in darkness, magic resistance (40%), telepathy 100 ft.

#### Devil, Hellstoker (Marnasoth)

Hellstokers stand just less than 6 feet tall and weigh about 180 pounds. Their rubbery, grayish-black flesh hangs loosely on their bodies, and is always smeared with a fine layer of yellowish-brown oil. Hellstokers have ovoid heads, no hair, and small upward curving horns. A hardened ridge of bone runs from their brow across the top of their head and disappears into their spine. Hellstokers have long, serpentine, forked tails. Their eyes are round with red or black pupils. A hellstoker carries a set of bellows that can fire a line of flame up to 30 feet. The oil coating a hellstoker is highly flammable, and any fire-based spell causes them to burst into flame, which adds an extra 1d6 points of damage to their claw attacks. Hellstokers can *teleport* at will. Once per day, they can cast *burning* *hands*. Hellstokers are immune to fire and poison, and take half damage from cold and acid.

- Devil, Hellstoker (Marnasoth) **HD** 5; **AC** 0 \[19\]; **Atk** 1 spear (1d8+3) or bellows (1d8 fire) or 2 claws (1d4+3); **Move** 9; **Save** 12; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: Bellows, fiery body, magical abilities, summon demons, +1 magic weapons to hit

#### Devil, Lilin

A lilin is a crimson-skinned woman about 5-1/2 feet tall with long dark hair. Her eyes are dark, almost black as is her hair. A pair of small bat-like wings protrudes from her shoulders. She wields a gleaming long sword. Lilins can use *ESP* and cast *charm person, charm monster* or *teleport* at will. Three times per day they can *animate dead*. They can see perfectly in darkness of any kind.

- Devil, Lilin **HD** 7; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d3), 1 weapon (1d8); **Move** 12/18 (flying); **Save** 9; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: Magic resistance (15%), immune to fire, magical abilities, +1 magic weapons to hit

#### Devil, Nupperibo

Those evil souls that are taken to Hell and processed to become lemures but fail ultimately become nupperibo: a life-form even more disgusting and sad than the lowly lemure. Nupperibos are vaguely humanoid. They have clawed hands and dark, grayish-black flesh. They are gathered by the dukes and arch devils and used as fodder in their never-ending wars. A nupperibo killed in battle is 99% likely to be reformed (by a duke or arch devil) into another nupperibo; the remaining 1% are “promoted” to lemure status, having proved their worth in combat. Nupperibos are blind and deaf but can ascertain all foes within 60 feet using scent and vibration. Nupperibos are immune to all mind-influencing effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects).

- Devil, Nupperibo **HD** 1; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** Spear (1d6) or 2 claws (1d4); **Move** 9; **Save** 17; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: +1 or better weapon to hit, immunity to fire and poison, mindless, regeneration (1 hp/round), see in darkness

#### Devil, Tormentor (Tormentor of Souls)

These reddish-gray scaled humanoids stand taller than a human. Their hands are clawed and its feet cloven. Oversized fangs jut from their upper jaw and drip foul-smelling saliva. Small horns protrude from just above its eyes, curving backwards. Their bodies are hairless and they have small curving tails. Tormentors of Souls, known as tormentor devils, make their way across the uppermost plane of Hell searching for souls that have entered the realms of evil. They are in the employ of this devil lord or that devil lord and return captured souls to their current master, where they are justly rewarded. Tormentors often employ hell hounds when pursuing renegade or runaway souls.

Tormentor devils can cast the following spells: *ESP, scorching ray* (1/day, as fireball but a 30-ft long ray that requires a ranged attack). A tormentor devil can track the soul of any creature that enters the planes of Hell.

A tormentor devil’s net looks like a normal net and acts like a normal net save that it can entrap incorporeal creatures. The net has many small razor-sharp barbs lining it. These barbs deal 1d4 points of damage each round to any creature caught in the net, including incorporeal creatures. A tormentor’s +1 battleaxe can also deal damage against incorporeal creatures.

- Devil, Tormentor **HD** 8; **AC** -1 \[20\]; **Atk** *+1 battleaxe* (1d8+1) or *soulcatcher net* (1d4 plus entanglement) or 2 claws (1d8); **Move** 12; **Save** 8; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 15/2900; **Special**: Magic weapons, spells, +1 or better weapon to hit, immunity to fire and poison, regeneration (2 hp/round), magic resistance (45%), see in darkness, soul track, telepathy 100 ft.

#### Unique Devil, Alastor (Executioner of Hell)

Huge bat-like wings spread from his scaled body and his arms end in clawed hands that hold a tight grip on a wickedly curved iron battleaxe named Grimfang. Alastor’s eyes are black with red pupils and its mouth is filled with rows of fangs. At will, Alastor can *dispel magic*, cast *fireball* or use *ESP*.

#### Unique Devil, Amon (Duke of Hell)

Amon is a wolf-headed demon who stands 9 feet tall. His fur is brownish-black and his eyes and teeth are yellow. Amon is a vassal in service to Geryon, commanding no less than 3 legions of bone devils. He is completely loyal to the Great Serpent and never questions his post. On more than one occasion an arch devil has tried to seduce Amon into betraying his lord, but such attempts always fail Amon’s iron citadel sits high on a flat-topped mountain within the domain of Hell’s fifth plane. It is a great, dark place filled with devils, wolves, and creatures far worse.

Amon’s gaze induces fear to a range of 30 feet. An affected creature must succeed on a saving throw or be affected as by a fear spell. Amon can cast the following spells: *Animate dead, charm monster, dispel magic, fly,* *produce flame, suggestion, symbol of discord* (1/day) and *wall of ice.* Once per day, Amon can summon a total of 40 HD of wolves and worgs.

#### Unique Devil, Baal (Duke of Hell)

Baal is a tall, golden-skinned humanoid dressed in battered bronze chainmail. His bovine head features large, round eyes of black, a large nose, the ears of a wolf and a large mouth lined with razor-sharp teeth. Tiny forward-curving horns protrude from his forehead. Baal is a duke in the employ of Great Mammon and leads 5 legions of barbed devils in his service. Baal follows Lord Mammon’s orders without question but secretly plans one day to wrest the throne from his master (who has become complacent as of late). For now, though, he waits and schemes.

Baal attacks with a *+3 morningstar* that can telescope to up to 8 feet in length. He radiates a 20-foot-radius aura of fear (save or affected as *fear* spell). He can cast the following spells: *Animate dead, cause serious* *wounds, charm monster, dispel magic, invisibility* (self), *phantasmal force,* *produce fire, pyrotechnics, shape change* (2/day)**,** *suggestion* and *symbol* *of stunning* (1/day).

He is a dog-headed humanoid with grayish-brown skin, pale scarlet eyes, two crimson horns, two large bat wings, hooved feet and a forked crimson tail. Baaphel is constantly scheming against the other dukes in Belial’s service and takes every opportunity to discredit them in the eyes of their lord, though he never does this openly; it is always through lesser dukes and other devils that his machinations come to fruition. Baaphel yearns to be ruler of an entire plane and is waiting anxiously until the time comes that he can overthrow his lord. Baaphel makes his home in a great castle of basalt and iron on Hell’s fourth plane.

Baaphel can induce fear by touch, an affected creature affected by a fear spell if they fail a saving throw. Baaphel can cast the following spells: *Charm monster, dispel magic, invisibility, suggestion,* *symbol of sleep* (1/day) and *transmute flesh to stone* (1/day). Twice per day Baaphel can automatically summon 4d10 nupperibos, 2d6 bearded devils, 1d4 barbed devils, bone devils, or erinyes or 1 ghaddar devil.

His eyes are ruby red, as are the small rounded horns that jut from his head just above his eyes. His hands and feet are humanoid and his nails are ruby red. His long, snaky, thin forked tail is crimson. Caasimolar wears robes of purple, white, amber, or sapphire. Underneath his robes his body is crimson with small scales.

#### Unique Devil, Demoriel (Twice-Exiled Seductress)

Demoriel was once a powerful angel who made her home in the heavens among the other angels. Demoriel’s journey into evil altered her appearance and left her with black hair, coal black eyes, amber skin, small horns protruding above her eyes, and a thin, snake-like forked tail. Small bat-like wings protrude from her shoulders, though she often keeps these folded against her back and hidden beneath her robes. Anyone seeing Demoriel must save or stand enthralled for 1 minute (as per a *hold person* spell). At will, Demoriel can *charm monster*, *detect good*, *detect magic*, *dispel magic*, cast a *fireball*, *teleport*, turn *invisible*, *polymorph self*, make a *suggestion*, and create a *wall of fire*.

#### Unique Devil, Geryon (Arch-Devil)

Geryon is a towering creature with the upper torso of a humanoid with paw-like hands, blue-furred arms, dark hair, and piercing black eyes, and the lower torso of a massive black and gold banded snake. Called “the Great Serpent”, he rules Hell’s fifth plane. His fortress, a large iron citadel located in the heart of a great city, is situated at the center of his plane. Geryon often leaves his fortress to wander the city, but rarely ever journeys beyond the city’s gates. The city is a large, dark place filled with all manner of filth. Geryon is one of the most powerful arch devils (by physical standards) and enjoys displaying his physical prowess to any who would watch, often destroying pit fiends or minor dukes for sheer pleasure and entertainment. While he is weaker than other arch devils (in station and overall power), he has allied himself with Mephistopheles and as such is feared by many. For all of Hell’s inhabitants know, if any can wrest the throne of Hell from Asmodeus, it is Mephistopheles, and Geryon wants to make sure he is on the winning side when the time comes to challenge the current Overlord.

Geryon’s gaze induces fear (as the spell) to a range of 30 feet. His tail sting delivers a deadly poison. Geryon casts spells as a 12th level magic-user. He can also use the following magical abilities: *Charm monster, dispel magic, geas, ice storm, invisibility, light, raise dead, symbol of stunning* (1/day) and *wall of ice*. Three times per day, Geryon can automatically summon 4d10 lemures or nupperibos, 2d8 bearded devils, 2d4 bone devils or barbed devils, or 2 ghaddar devils or pit fiends.

#### Unique Devil, Gorson (The Blood Duke)

The Blood Duke, Gorson, is a great lion-bodied centaur that serves Great Mammon as 2nd general of his infernal army. Gorson leads 5 legions of barbed devils in service to his lord. Gorson is called “The Lion” for his ferocity in battle and his general appearance. He often takes the entrails of those he has slain and makes a necklace, wrapping it around his neck or entwining them in his bloody mane-like hair. Wounds from his battleaxe do heal naturally, and until a *remove curse* is cast upon them, healing spells cure only 1 point of damage per casting.

Gorson can cast the following spells: *Animate dead, charm monster, dispel magic, produce flame, suggestion, symbol of stunning* (1/day) and *wall of fire*.

#### Unique Devil, Hutijin (Duke of Hell)

He has a mouth filled with sharpened teeth and two oversized canine teeth and upward curving horns project from his head. Hutijin is a loyal servant of Mephistopheles and commands 2 companies of pit fiends in the infernal armies of the eighth plane of Hell. Hutijin is a noble of Mephistopheles’ court and commands much respect from the other dukes and nobles. His battle prowess and strong demeanor command respect from the other dukes of Hell.

Hutijin can cause fear by speaking. Creatures within 30 feet that hear his voice must succeed on a saving throw or be affected as though by a *fear* spell (caster level 20th). He can also cast the following spells: *Animate dead, cure serious wounds, dispel magic, fireball*, *hold monster*, *invisibility, polymorph self, produce flame, suggestion*, *symbol of stunning* (1/day) and *wall of fire*.

#### Unique Devil, Lucifer (Prince of Darkness)

Lucifer has many names: The Prince of Lies, The Prince of Darkness, The Adversary, The Prince of Light, and Satan. It is believed that Lucifer was the first devil in existence, having been cast down from the heavens when he challenged the rulings of the gods of law. After being cast down, Lucifer constructed a plane he called Hell. There he built his palace of iron and basalt on the lowest and darkest region of Hell. He divided this realm into nine distinct regions and appointed his closest allies to rule. Each lord was allowed to mold and shape his domain as he saw fit, but all paid homage to Lucifer.

A millennia passed and Lucifer reigned supreme in Hell. During this time, one of the lieutenants (each of which had now become known as arch-devils or rulers) decided he could do a much better job of running Hell than Lucifer could. Asmodeus coveted the Throne of Hell and wanted it for himself. Using his powers of persuasion, he promised each and every other arch-devil that stood with him and challenged Lucifer a larger role in the “new” Hells. Those that stood against him, he said, would be destroyed or cast out of Hell along with Lucifer when the end came. This time in Hell’s history became known as the Great Uprising.

Asmodeus managed to sway every single arch-devil, save one. Belial refused to stand with Asmodeus and barely escaped capture at the hands of the other arch-devils. When the battle for Hell’s Throne commenced, Belial, Lucifer, and their allies stood fast against the mighty armies of the other arch-devils. In the end however, the sheer numbers of devils that fought against Lucifer overwhelmed his armies and those that stood with him. Lucifer and his allies were forced to flee Hell or face destruction. The sole exception was Belial. Near the end of the war when he saw that Lucifer would likely lose the Throne, Belial turned and joined Asmodeus’ ranks and helped oust Lucifer from Hell.

Cast out, Lucifer wanted vengeance. But vengeance required power, and he was tired, injured, and weakened from the time spent battling in Hell. He needed a place to rest, a place to grow in power, and a place to plan. Thus he created Infernus, a plane of eternal and everlasting fire and suffering: one plane, one ruler; created by his own hands, his own blood, and a portion of his very essence. From his great keep, *Malefacta,* Lucifer waits for the day he can challenge for the Throne of Hell again.

Lucifer is said to be one with the plane. As the gods of law are to the upper planes, so is Lucifer to Infernus. Nothing goes unnoticed by him on Infernus. All movements are seen, all whispers are heard. A plan is not hatched or contrived in this place without Lucifer’s knowledge. When people speak of Infernus, they speak of Lucifer and vice versa. No creature, it is thought, stands a chance against Lucifer on Infernus, not even the arch-devils that stood against him a millennia ago. But Lucifer knows that when the battle comes, he will have to fight the arch-devils on their own planes, not on Infernus, and he is preparing for just that. By sending his agents to the Material Plane to corrupt lawful beings and convert those currently paying homage to Hell’s rulers, Lucifer grows in strength. And this strength gives him power, power that surpasses any he ever had—including his near deific powers he possessed in the planes of good. And when his power finally reaches its pinnacle, he will travel to Hell and destroy it and every single inhabitant.

Lucifer is an exquisitely handsome humanoid with jet black hair and a forked beard. His hands end in wicked claws and his feet are cloven. A long snake-like tail dances behind him and intertwines itself around the massive triple-pronged pitchfork he carries. Two oversized and backward-curving blackened horns jut from his head. He is cloaked in a suit of banded armor that glistens with the color of the night sky.

Lucifer has two gaze weapons. Each gaze weapon has a range of 30 feet. His first forces victims to pass a saving throw or have their alignment shift one step toward chaotic. The second gaze weapon curses the victim with a -4 penalty to all attack rolls and saving throws.

Lucifer’s tail ends in a deadly stinger that delivers lethal venom.

Lucifer casts spells as a 15th level cleric and a 12th level magic-user. He can also use the following magical abilities at will: *Animate dead, charm monster*, *darkness, dispel magic, ESP, fireball, geas, hold monster*, *ice storm*, *invisibility, locate object, meteor swarm* (2/day)*, phantasmal force, polymorph self, produce flame, pyrotechnics, restoration* (2/day)*, shapechange* (2/day)*, symbol of death* (1/day)*, symbol of fear* (2/day)*, teleport, wall of fire, wall of ice* and *wish* (1/day).

Once per week, Lucifer can attempt to summon each arch devil to his palace on the nethermost plane of Hell. The arch devil can resist with its magic resistance, but gets no saving throw. Lucifer cannot currently use this ability while in Infernus. Three times per day, Lucifer can summon 4d10 lemures or nupperibos, 2d8 bearded devils or chain devils, 2d4 bone devils, ice devils, or erinyes, 1d6 barbed devils or ghaddar devils, or 1d3 pit fiends.

> ***Rod of Infernus*:** Lucifer’s black iron rod functions as a *+5 heavy mace*. Any lawful creature that touches the rod must pass a saving throw or suffer 10d6 points of electricity damage per round. Once per round, and no more than five times per day, the rod can fire a ray to a range of 60 feet. A creature struck by this ray must succeed on a saving throw at -2 or be annihilated instantly—not even a trace of dust is left behind. No form of mortal magic can restore life to a creature annihilated by this ray. Once per round, and no more than three times per day, the rod can fire a ray of hellish-red energy to a range of 60 feet that functions as a *magic jar* spell. A target can make a saving throw to resist the effects. If failed, the victim’s soul vanishes into Lucifer’s rod. Up to 10 such souls can be held in the rod at one time.

- Lucifer, Prince of Darkness **HD** 25 (150 hp); **AC** -6 \[25\]; **Atk** *Rod of Infernus* (3d6), bite (2d4 plus poison) or 2 claws (2d8), bite (2d4 plus poison), tail sting (1d8 plus poison); **Move** 21/30 (flying); **Save** 3; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 40/10400; **Special**: Gaze weapons, spells, summon devils, +3 or better weapon to hit, immunity to fire and poison, regeneration (4 hp/round), magic resistance (90%), see in darkness, telepathy 100 ft.

#### Unique Devil, Moloch (Arch-Devil)

Moloch rules the sixth plane of Hell, a flat, stinking plane of acrid smoke and soot. He is currently plotting to wrest control of the plane completely from its true ruler, Baalzebul, for Moloch is nothing more than a lieutenant in Baalzebul’s infernal army or seneschal to Baalzebul’s court. Yet before he puts in motion steps to secure his plane, he must first deal with the machinations of the Great Serpent, Geryon. Geryon and Moloch hate each other; their infernal armies are constantly warring with each other either openly or through subterfuge.

Moloch is a massive, barrel-chested, hairless humanoid that stands 14 feet tall. His head is squat and large and its oversized mouth is filled with rows of wickedly-sharp teeth. His eyes are sapphire blue and his large, curving horns are black. His flesh is dark brown. He wields a long black metal rod with 6 long pliable metal tails.

Once per round, Moloch can breathe a cone of fear to a range of 30 feet. Affected creatures must succeed on a saving throw or be affected as by a *fear* spell.

Moloch casts spells as a 12th level cleric. He can use the following magical abilities at will: *Animate dead, charm monster*, *dispel magic, firestorm* (1/day), *fly, geas, phantasmal force*, *polymorph self, produce flame, raise dead, suggestion*, *symbol of stunning* (1/day), *wall of fire*. Twice per day, Moloch can summon 4d10 lemures or nupperibos, 2d6 bearded devils, 2d4 bone devils, 1d4 horned devils or barbed devils, or 1d2 pit fiends.

***Unholy Shocking Six-Tailed Whip:*** Moloch’s *+3 six-tailed whip* deals an extra 1d6 points of electricity damage on a successful hit.

#### Servants of Moloch

Followers of Moloch are evil humanoids and usually consist of assassins, clerics and magic-users. Devout followers of Moloch are called Knights of Moloch and must sign a pact of evil with Moloch. Knights can receive up to 3rd level cleric spells from Moloch.

#### Unique Devil, Xaphan (Duke of Infernus)

Xaphan is 13 feet tall and resembles a satyr, with the lower torso of a goat and the upper body of a powerful humanoid. His skin is blackish-brown and the fur on his lower torso black. Two small horns jut from his forehead, just above his golden eyes. His hair is long and black, and he often wears it in a braided ponytail. Two large, leathery bat-like wings protrude from his back. Xaphan can cause his entire body to erupt in flame, doing 2d6 points of damage to all creatures within 5 feet (no save). In addition, any creature meeting his gaze must save or begin to burn from the inside out, dealing 1d6 points on the 1st round, 3d6 on the 2nd, and 6d6 on the 3rd. The victim gets a save each round to negate the continuing damage. Xaphan casts spells as a 20th-level Magic-User. At will he can cast *animate dead*, *create darkness (15 foot radius)*, *cause fear*, *detect magic*, *dispel magic*, *fireball*, *pyrotechnics*, or *wall of fire*. Once per day he can cast *power word kill*, *symbol of fear* and *limited wish*.

### Devil Dog

The wolf-like devil dog is larger than a wolf — about 5 feet long and 3 feet high at the shoulder. It has frost white fur that blends in almost perfectly with its snowbound environment, becoming effectively invisible when more than 30 feet away. Devil dogs have glowing blue eyes. When a devil dog bays, all creatures within 30 feet with fewer HD than the devil dog that hear it must succeed on a saving throw or become frightened for 2d6 rounds, suffering a -1 penalty to all hit rolls and saving throws. When the devil dog’s to hit roll beats its target’s AC by 4 or more, the victim suffers a throat attack. A throat attack deals double damage and stuns the victim for 2d4 rounds if they fail a saving throw. Stunned creatures die unless healing magic is applied before the end of the duration of the stun.

- Devil Dog: **HD** 6; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** Bite (1d6); **Move** 21; **Save** 11; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: Frightening howl, immune to cold, throat attack

### Diger

Digers are semi-transparent oozes about 9 feet in diameter that live in abandoned ruins or underground areas where they spend most of their time hunting for food. A large, reddish-colored gem, actually an eye, floats near the center of the creature. A diger’s gem-like eye offers it a means to lure its prey in so it can attack. A character has a 1 in 6 (2 in 6 for dwarves and elves) to realize the gem is not real. A diger attacks by hitting a foe with its slimy appendage, or by simply waiting, floating unnoticed until an opponent contacts it. A diger secretes a digestive acid that dissolves only flesh. Any melee hit deals acid damage. Digers also secrete an anaesthetizing slime. A creature making physical contact with a diger must succeed on a saving throw or be paralyzed for 1d6 rounds. Digers do not deliver this paralysis with an attack by one of their slimy appendages. A diger can automatically engulf a paralyzed foe. An opponent remains paralyzed for as long as it remains engulfed. A paralyzed foe is considered to be grappled and takes 1d4 points of acid damage every 10 minutes as the diger slowly digests it. By releasing naturally occurring helium from its body, a diger is able to fly for 2 rounds. After that, it must land and cannot fly again until it has rested for 2 rounds.

- Diger: **HD** 2; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** Slimy appendage (1d4 plus 1d4 acid), surprise in water on 1-5 on 1d6; **Move** 3/12 (flying, swimming); **Save** 16; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 4/60; **Special**: Acid, engulf, paralysis, limited flight

### Dinosaurs

Dinosaurs are particularly useful in time-traveling adventures, for valleys that time forgot, or for the mounts of sword & sorcery barbarians.

#### Ankylosaurus

An ankylosaurus looks like a turtle with spikes around the edge of its shell and elephant-like legs. It has a tail with a clubbed end. They are herbivores, and travel in small groups.

- Ankylosaurus: **HD** 9; **AC** 0 \[19\]; **Atk** 1 clubbed tail (3d6); **Move** 6; **Save** 6; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 9/1100; **Special**: None.

#### Elasmosaurus

Fish-like, 15-ft. long carnivores, the elasmosaurus has a long neck like a sea serpent, but has a thick, saurian body with fins. This is a good sea monster for use in campaigns where the dark horrors of the far-forgotten past might still survive. These creatures cannot survive more than a few minutes on land.

- Elasmosaurus: **HD** 15; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 1 bite (4d6); **Move** 1 (Swim 15); **Save** 9; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 7/600; **Special**: Aquatic.

#### Triceratops

A triceratops has three horns protruding from its face, and a protective plate rising like an armored frill behind its head. They are extremely hard to damage with frontal assaults. The bony plate behind the head would also provide excellent protection for a rider. The horns inflict double damage if the creature charges.

- Triceratops: **HD** 16; **AC** 1 \[18\] front, 6 \[13\] back; **Atk** 1 bite (1d8) and 2 gore (1d12); **Move** 9; **Save** 3; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 17/3500; **Special**: Charge.

#### Tyrannosaurus

Tyrannosaurus is a deadly carnivorous dinosaur, walking on two legs and attacking with a massively powerful bite. When it bites prey, it grabs the victim in its jaws, shaking and chewing for 3d8 points of automatic damage in subsequent rounds. It can inflict such damage even against opponents as large as a brontosaurus. Only creatures with shells, bone frills, or spines can avoid the horrendous tearing damage a tyrannosaur can inflict (e.g., triceratops, stegosaurus, ankylosaurus).

- Tyrannosaurus Rex: **HD** 18; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 1 bite (5d8); **Move** 15; **Save** 3; **CL/XP** 19/4100; **Special**: Chew for automatic 3d8 damage after bite.

### Dire Bison

Dire bison resemble their smaller normal-sized relatives. They can grow to a length of 20 feet and weigh up to 6,000 pounds. Humanoids often hunt dire bison for the value of their pelts as well as the copious amounts of meat they can provide. A single dire bison can feed a village for weeks.

A frightened herd of dire bison flees as a group in a random direction (but always away from the perceived source of danger). They literally run over anything smaller than they are that gets in their way, dealing 2d12 points of damage per each 5 dire bison in the herd (saving throw for half damage).

- Dire Bison: **HD** 9; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** Butt (2d6); **Move** 18; **Save** 7; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 9/1100; **Special**: Stampede

### Dire Corby

Dire corbies are wingless bipedal crows with slick black feathers, powerful arms that end in razor-sharp claws and a gold beaks. They dwell deep beneath the surface world, making their homes in large, open caverns, hollowing out individual shelters in the walls themselves. These creatures do not possess wings now, but did in some remote part of their past. Dire corbies are omnivores but prefer a diet of fresh meat, enjoying the flesh of subterranean rodents, animals, and even other races. They are particularly fond of the flesh of bats, savoring the leathery grit of their flesh. Dire corbies speak their own language of clicks and tweets. More intelligent dire corbies have a 10% chance of speaking Common as well. Dire corbies hunt in flocks. They enjoy the thrill of the hunt and enjoy running their prey down, toying with it before swooping in and tearing it to shreds with their claws. Dire corbies always fight to the death and never flee, even when faced with overwhelming odds.

#### Dire corbies as Characters

Dire corby flocks are usually led by fighters. Dire corby characters are capable of seeing in the dark as elves. Their keen hearing assures that they never suffer penalties for fighting blind and succeed at listening through doors and thin walls on a roll of 1-3 on 1d6. A dire corby’s feathers and thick skin give is a natural AC of 8 \[11\]. Their coloration allows them to surprise foes on a roll of 1-2 on 1d6 in areas of darkness. Dire corbies can advance to 8th level as fighters (or up to 9th level with a strength of 14 or higher) and 4th level as thieves (or up to 5th level with a dexterity of 16 or higher).

- Dire Corby: **HD** 2; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d4); **Move** 12; **Save** 16; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 2/30; **Special**: None

### Dire Deer

A dire deer stands 6 feet at the shoulder and weighs 1,000 pounds. It has an impressive rack of antlers up to 8 feet wide. Dire deer are hunted for their meat as well as their tough hides. A reasonably intact dire deer hide is worth 50 gp. Dire deer usually flee combat, but rutting males are highly aggressive. A dire deer attacks by goring with its antlers or by rearing on its hind legs and smacking opponents with its hooves.

- Dire Deer: **HD** 5; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** Gore (1d8) or 2 hooves (1d6); **Move** 18; **Save** 12; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Surprise on roll of 1-3 on 1d6

### Dire Dog

Dire dogs are the domestic equivalent of dire wolves. They are large, vicious canines highly prized for their ability to track and kill opponents much larger than themselves. Domesticated dire dogs are often trained and outfitted for war in spiked, studded leather armor. Orcs use trained dire dogs in warfare.

- Dire Dog: **HD** 3; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** bite (1d6); **Move** 18; **Save** 18; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**: None

### Dire Elephant

A dire elephant is a truly tremendous animal, as large as some dinosaurs. It stands 20 feet high at the shoulder, and weighs many tons. Its trunk is thicker than a human’s body and is 20 feet long.

A dire elephants is as intelligent as a normal elephant and can be trained to carry a howdah almost as big as a house. Trained and outfitted for war, a dire elephant is a nearly unstoppable dreadnaught from which warriors can launch swarms of arrows. Some dire elephants are trained as mobile siege engines, even to the point of having catapults and ballistae mounted on their backs. War engineers have for centuries pondered how to use dire elephants to pull down entire castles, but have been frustrated by the prospects of inventing ropes strong enough for the task.

The victim of a dire elephant’s trunk attack must pass a saving throw or be grabbed and squeezed for 3d6 per round. The dire elephant can drop a creature it has snatched for 2d6 points of falling damage or fling it aside. A flung creature travels 1d6×10 feet, and takes 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet it traveled.

A dire elephant can inflict 3d8 points of trampling damage by moving over the top of smaller creatures.

A light load for a dire elephant is 33,200 pounds; a medium load, 33,201-66,402 pounds; and a heavy load, 66,402-99,600 pounds. A dire elephant can drag 498,000 pounds.

- Dire Elephant: **HD** 24; **AC** 1 \[18\]; **Atk** Slam (3d6) and 2 stomps (3d6) or gore (3d8); **Move** 18; **Save** 3; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 24/5600; **Special**: Trample

### Dire Goat

Dire goats stand 3 feet tall at the shoulder and resemble their smaller cousins. Although they are normally wild, domesticated dire goats are not unheard of. They are domesticated their meat as well as the amounts of milk they can produce. Dire goats are non-aggressive unless threatened or provoked. A dire goat rams opponents with its head, or tries to run them over, inflicting 1d6 points of damage doing so.

- Dire Goat: **HD** 3; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** Head butt (1d6); **Move** 18; **Save** 14; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**: Trample

### Dire Hippopotamus (Behemoth)

Dire hippos resemble their smaller cousins and grow up to 20 feet long and can weigh up to 10,000 pounds.

Dire hippos gave rise to the legends of the behemoth, a massive beast that can drink entire rivers, and make the earth tremble when it walks. Although they can’t quite drink it all, dire hippos are the undisputed masters of the river in which they reside. All predators give them a wide berth.

A submerged dire hippo that surfaces under a boat or ship less than 20 feet long capsizes the vessel 95% of the time. It has a 50% chance to capsize a vessel from 20-60 feet long and a 20% chance to capsize a vessel over 60 feet long.

A dire hippo can hold its breath for 10 minutes before it risks drowning.

- Dire Hippopotamus (Behemoth): **HD** 13; **AC** 1 \[18\]; **Atk** Bite (3d6); **Move** 15; **Save** 14; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 13/2300; **Special**: Capsize

### Dire Moose

A dire moose is over 20 feet long from nose to tail. Its rack of antlers is 18 feet across. Dire moose are hunted only by the brave, as their sheer size and strength makes them nearly unbeatable foes. A hunter that can mount a pair of dire moose antlers is sure to receive the praise and admiration of his fellows. A dire moose charges with its antlers, but it can rear onto its hind legs and batter opponents with its hooves.

- Dire Moose: **HD** 9; **AC** 1 \[18\]; **Atk** Head butt (2d6) and 2 hooves (1d8); **Move** 15; **Save** 7; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 9/1100; **Special**: Surprise on roll of 1-2 on 1d6

### Dire Porcupine

The dire porcupine ranges in size from 3 to 4 feet in height and can weigh up to 80 pounds. When the porcupine is relaxed, the hair and quills lie flat and point toward the rear of its body. When threatened, it draws up the skin of the back to expose quills facing all directions.

Dire porcupines are passive until threatened. When faced with possible combat, the dire porcupine raises the quills on its body and spins around, smashing an opponent with its quill-covered tail. If it bites an opponent, 1d4 quills break off from its body and lodge in the opponent.

When the dire porcupine strikes with its tail, it dislodges 1d6 quills that automatically break off and lodge in the opponent’s flesh. A lodged quill imposes a -1 circumstance penalty to attacks and saving throws. Each 1 minute thereafter, the quill moves deeper into the opponent’s flesh, dealing 1d3 additional points of damage. Removing the quill takes 1 round and deals 1d4 additional points of damage. If the quill has been embedded for more than 2 rounds, an open doors check is needed to remove the quill. An unarmed or melee touch attack against a dire porcupine causes 1d4 quills to break off and lodge in the attacker.

- Dire Moose: **HD** 1; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 1d6 quills (1d4) and bite (1d4); **Move** 12; **Save** 17; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 2/30; **Special**: Quills

### Dire Ram

Dire rams are larger, meaner cousins of normal rams. They can grow to a length of 10 feet and weigh as much as 1,000 pounds. Dire rams are the majestic lords of their domain, and tolerate not incursion by predators.

A dire ram is such a tenacious combatant that it continues to fight without penalty for 1d4 rounds after its hit points are reduced to 0.

- Dire Ram: **HD** 5; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** Butt (1d8); **Move** 15; **Save** 12; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Ferocity

### Dire Skunk

A dire skunk is 3 feet long, with a tail that rises 2 feet into the air. When aroused, it stamps it forefeet and hisses. A dire skunk gives its opponents every opportunity to back down and leave the area. If it is not left alone, a dire skunk rises onto its forelegs and sprays its musk. A dire skunk bites an opponent not driven away by the odor.

Once per round, and no more than 5 times per day, a dire skunk can release a cloud of stinking musk that quickly fills a 5-foot area in front of it. A creature within or entering the area must succeed on a saving throw or be sickened for 1d4 rounds. One round later a second save must be made (whether the first one succeeded or not) or the affected creature is blinded for 1d4 rounds. A *neutralize poison* spell removes the effect from the sickened creature, but does not remove the blindness.

The stench is highly potent, and short of magical means of cleaning, all cloth and such material continue to reek for 1d6 months. The odor is so strong that it doubles all chances for wandering monster encounters and imposes a -50% penalty on an assassin or thief’s ability to hide in shadows while wearing clothing contaminated with a skunk’s musk. Flesh, leather goods, and metal goods (weapons, armor, and so on) must be washed in a concentrated mixture of vinegar for a period of 1d3 days. Otherwise, the stench clings to them for at least 1 week.

- Dire Skunk: **HD** 1; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** Bite (1d4); **Move** 12; **Save** 17; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 1/15; **Special**: Musk

### Dire Sloth

Dire sloths grow up to be 7 feet long and weigh up to 250 pounds. The fur of a dire sloth is stained green by algae. A dire sloth that hits with both claw attacks latches onto the opponent’s body and tears the flesh for an additional 1d4 points of damage.

- Dire Sloth: **HD** 3; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d4) and bite (1d6); **Move** 6/12 (climbing); **Save** 14; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**: Rend with claws, move or attack each round, surprise on roll of 1-2 on 1d6 in wooded environment

### Disenchanter

A disenchanter resembles a lightly-built, blue-furred dromedary with slightly translucent skin and a long snout ending in something akin to a suction cup. The disenchanter is greatly feared for the damage it can cause. Much like a rust monster, it feeds on objects most adventurers hold near and dear to their hearts—magic items. A typical disenchanter is about 8 feet long and weighs 600 pounds. A disenchanter targets magical items carried or worn by an opponent. A disenchanter is able to discern the most powerful magical items in a group and always attack those items first, unless those items are too difficult to reach (such as hidden in a backpack), in which case the disenchanter will choose to attack a more readily available item (such as a magical shield). It fastens its snout onto an item and drains the item’s magical properties unless its owner passes a saving throw. The item hit is determined randomly by the Referee. If the disenchanter aims for a specific item, it suffers a -6 penalty to hit. Magical weapons are not drained of their magical properties if they merely strike a disenchanter - the weapon must be struck by the creature’s snout to be drained.

- Disenchanter: **HD** 5; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** Snout (disenchantment) or 2 hooves (1d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 12; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 7/600; **Special**: Disenchant, +1 or better weapon to hit

### Djinni

Djinn are one of the genies of folklore, creatures of the air (and possibly of the elemental planes). They can carry 700 pounds of weight, and have a number of magical powers. A djinni can create food and water of high quality, as well as wooden and cloth objects. They can also create objects of metal (including coins), but all such magically created metals disappear in time. Djinn can call up illusions, and although these are quite excellent they disappear when touched. Djinni can turn themselves into gaseous form (cannot attack or be attacked, can enter any area that is not airtight), and can become invisible at will. Finally, a djinni can turn itself into a whirlwind much like an air elemental, sweeping away any creature with one or fewer hit dice (the diameter of the whirlwind is 10ft. More powerful types of djinn might be capable of granting limited wishes or even true wishes.

- Djinni: **HD** 7+3; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 1 fist or weapon (2d8); **Move** 9 (Fly 24); **Save** 9; **AL** Any; **CL/XP** 9/1100; **Special**: Magical powers, whirlwind.

### Dog

These are large, trained dogs. Normal dogs would have hit dice 1 or lower, and inflict no more than 1d3 points of damage.

- Dog (Pet or Wild): **HD** 1; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d3); **Move** 15; **Save** 17; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 1/15; **Special**: None.
- Guard/War Dog: **HD** 2; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d6); **Move** 14; **Save** 16; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 2/30; **Special**: None.

### Dolphin/Porpoise

Dolphins are unlikely to be opponents in most adventures, but they might be enchanted guardians, or “dark” dolphins of evil temperament.

- Dolphin: **HD** 2; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d6); **Move** 0 (Swim 24); **Save** 16; **CL/XP** 2/30; **Special**: None.

### Doppelganger

A doppelganger can change its form to resemble the physical appearance (including clothing and gear) of any person. These creatures are immune to sleep and charm, and are considered magic resistant for purposes such as breaking through *wizard locks* and similar spells. They have a very good saving throw (5) against magic of all kinds.

- Doppelganger: **HD** 4; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 1 claw (1d12); **Move** 9; **Save** 13 (5 vs magic); **AL** C; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Mimics shape, immune to sleep and charm.

### Dracolisk

*This creature resembles a young six-legged dragon with glistening scales and gleaming eyes.*

The vicious dracolisk is a rare crossbreed of dragon and basilisk. A dracolisk has a scaled body the same color as its dragon parent that fades to a lighter shade on its underside. A short, curved horn, similar to a rhino’s, juts from its nose. Like the basilisk, it has six legs. Its dragon-like wings match its body color but fade to a slightly darker shade near the tips. A dracolisk’s eyes are pale green with sparkles that match its dragon-parent color. Dracolisks speak a crude and broken form of the language of their dragon parent. Black dracolisks can be found in warm marshes, deserts, or underground; blue dracolisks favor warm hills and mountains, rarely being found underground; green dracolisks favor temperate or warm forests and underground settings; red dracolisks favor warm mountains and underground settings; and white dracolisks favor cold mountains, cold deserts, and underground. A dracolisk has the breath weapon of its parent. It can use its breath weapon three times per day, inflicting 4d8 points of damage with it.

**Dracolisk Variety Breath Weapon**
Black 60-foot line of acid
Blue 60-foot line of electricity
Green 30-foot cone of acidic gas
Red 30-foot cone of fire
White 30-foot cone of cold

Like the basilisk, the dracolisk’s gaze turns people to stone. The gaze has a range of 30 feet, and potential victims receive a saving throw to avoid the gaze.

- Dracolisk: **HD** 11; **AC** 2\[17\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d6), bite (2d6); **Move** 12/24 (flying); **Save** 4; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 14/2600; **Special**: Breath weapon, petrifying gaze

### Draconid

A draconid appears as a giant spider with eight spindly legs. Where its head should be, two long serpentine necks sprout from its body. Atop each neck sits a dragon-like head. A draconid’s spidery body is grayish-black and covered in short, coarse fur. Its heads and necks are scaled gray and fade to a grayish-black as they near the body. Each draconid head can breathe a jet of fire once every 1d4 rounds in a line 10 feet wide, 10 feet high and 30 feet long. Each jet deals 3d6 points of damage (save for half). A draconid’s bite delivers a toxic poison. Draconids can throw a web up to six times per day up to 50 feet that is similar to a *web* spell.

- Draconid: **HD** 15; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 2 bites (2d6 + poison); **Move** 9/3 (climb); **Save** 3; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 17/3,500; **Special**: Breath weapon, poison, web, resists fire

### Dragolem

Dragolems are golems fashioned in the shape of dragons. These powerful constructs are usually used to guard valuable artifacts or vast treasures. A dragolem is unintelligent and is unaffected by charm spells, hold, sleep or other mind altering spells, as well a gases, cold, and fire. Dragolems are also immune to all spells of up to level 4, and to normal and silver weapons. Dragolems are able to see the invisible and 3 times per day they may breathe a poisonous cloud (20 X 20 X 20ft). The victim of the poisonous cloud must make a successful saving throw or die. *(Author: Skathros).*

- Dragolem: **HD** 8; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d6), 1 bite (2d10) or breath; **Move** 12 (fly 24); **Save** 8; **CL/XP** 12/2000; **Special**: Breath, Immunities.

### Dragons

The size of a dragon is roughly 5 ft of body length per age category, up to the adult size of 20 ft. Dragons have double normal treasure (that is, a gold piece value of four times the dragon’s XP value).

Do not roll hit points for dragons as normal. Instead, determine the number of hit dice and the age category of the dragon. The age category indicates both the dragon’s hit points per die and how much damage the dragon’s breath weapon inflicts, given as points per hit die.:

- (1) Very young dragon: 1 hit point per hit die, 1 hit point per die inflicted by breath weapon.
- (2) Young: 2 hit points per hit die, 2 hit points per die inflicted by breath weapon.
- (3) Immature: 3 hit points per hit die, 3 hit points per die inflicted by breath weapon.
- (4) Adult: 4 hit points per hit die, 4 hit points per die inflicted by breath weapon.
- (5) Old: 5 hit points per hit die, 5 hit points per die inflicted by breath weapon.
- (6) Very Old (100 years old): 6 hit points per hit die, 6 hit points per die inflicted by breath weapon.
- (7) Aged (100-400 years old): 7 hit points per die, 7 hit points per die inflicted by breath weapon
- (8) Ancient (400+ years old): 8 hit points per die, 8 hit points per die inflicted by breath weapon

Note that dragons, while they are dangerous opponents, are not by any means invincible. In a medieval-type fantasy world, dragons are a common problem rather than godlike creatures of legend—so the statistics for dragons reflect a deadly but not mythical foe. The Referee is, of course, free to create stats for a more “mythical” conception of dragons. Since dice are not rolled for dragon hit points, it is possible for a truly mythical dragon to have more points per die than it is actually possible to roll on a hit die.

Breath Weapons: All dragons have a breath weapon of some kind, which can be used three times in a day. The Referee chooses when a dragon will use its breath weapon, or may roll a 60% chance in any given round. Damage inflicted by a dragon’s breath weapon is indicated under the age category. When used breath weapons appear in three different shapes:

**1** — Cloud-shape for gaseous exhalations
**2** — A line, for spitting dragons**3** — Cone shape for any others.

The dimensions of a dragon’s breath differ according to the dragon’s type.

If a dragon is beaten down by subdual damage (see rules for Combat), the dragon will surrender and serve its conquerors, even to the point of allowing itself to be sold. However, subdued dragons are only loyal while they are impressed by and frightened of their masters; signs of weakness may cause the dragon to escape or even attack its master.

A standard-colored dragon generally has a challenge level based on its hit points: CL=(hp/4) +2.

#### Black Dragon

Black dragons spit a deadly, corrosive acid which covers everything in a line 5 feet wide and 60 feet long. Black dragons have a 45% chance of being able to talk; talking black dragons have a 5% chance of being able to cast 1d4 first-level Magic-User spells.

#### Blue Dragon

Blue dragons spit a blast of lightning in a line 5 ft wide and 100 ft long, affecting everything in its path. A saving throw indicates half damage. Blue dragons have a 65% chance of being able to talk; talking blue dragons have a 15% chance of being able to cast 1d4 first-level Magic-User spells and 1d3 second-level Magic-User spells.

#### Brass Dragon

Brass dragons are greedy, but not as inimical to humankind as most of their kin. A brass dragon can breath a cone-shaped blast of sleep gas (70ft long, to a width of 20ft at the end), or a cloud of fear gas 50 ft. in diameter (20ft from the ground to the top of the cloud). A saving throw is required for anyone caught in a brass dragon’s breath weapon, regardless of level. Sleep lasts until the victim is physically awakened; fear causes the victim to flee for 3d6 rounds. Brass dragons have a 50% chance of being able to talk; talking brass dragons have a 5% chance of being able to cast 1d4 first level magic-user spells. Brass dragons range in size from 6 to 8 hit dice.

- Adult Brass [Dragon](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Dragons) (6 HD): **HD** 6 (24hp); **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d4), 1 bite (3d6); **Move** 12 (Fly 24); **Save** 11; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: Fear or sleep breath.

#### Bronze Dragon

Bronze dragons are generally quite friendly to humankind. They can spit lightning in a line 100ft long (5-ft. wide) or exhale a cloud of misdirection gas in a 30 ft. diameter (20ft from ground to top of cloud). The misdirection gas forces anyone failing a saving throw to retreat away from the dragon for 6 full combat rounds. The lightning bolt causes full damage (age category times dragon’s hit dice) on a failed saving throw, half damage with a successful saving throw. Bronze dragons have a 70% chance of being able to talk; talking bronze dragons have a 15% chance of being able to cast 1d4 first level magic-user spells and 1d3 second level magic-user spells. These dragons range in size from 8 to 10 hit dice.

#### Cloud Dragon (Draco Nimbus Celo)

Cloud dragons are the most reclusive of all dragons, rarely leaving the safety and sanctity of their cloudy lairs. They have fringed and frilled heads and wings that sweep back from shoulders to tail. Large, piercing rose colored eyes dominate their somewhat triangular heads. A cloud dragon wyrmling’s scales are silvery-blue with a slight hint of red at the tip of each scale. As the dragon ages, its color slowly changes to a bright sunset orange. The oldest cloud dragons resemble gold dragons, save for the large bony plates on their heads and backs. Their tails trail off becoming misty and translucent near the tip. Cloud dragons have a great disdain for non-flying creatures and creatures that must use non-natural means to fly. Cloud dragons are not highly aggressive, but dislike interlopers and attack them on sight.

A cloud dragon has one type of breath weapon, a cone of icy cold air. Creatures smaller than the cloud dragon must succeed on a saving throw or be knocked down and blown back 2d12 feet plus 3 feet per age category of the cloud dragon. A creature takes 1d4 points of damage per 10 feet it is blown back. Flying creatures are buffeted and blown back twice the distance and sustain 2d6 points of damage per 10 feet.

The cloud dragon can assume a cloudy form and remain in this form indefinitely. While in cloud form, it can still use spells but cannot use its breath weapon or make physical attacks. This ability is otherwise identical to the *gaseous form* spell.

Twice per day, an adult or older cloud dragon can create a maximum of 81 cubic feet of water as per the *create water* spell, the water falling from the sky in the form of rain. In addition, it can cast the following spells: *Call lightning* (2/day), *control weather* (2/day), *obscuring mist* (3/day) and *stinking cloud* (2/day).

#### Copper Dragon

Copper dragons are generally hostile to evil/chaos, although they are not necessarily friendly to humans, either. They are greedy and covet wealth. A copper dragon can choose to spit a line of acid 5-ft. wide and 60ft long (saving throw for half damage), or to exhale a cloud of gas 30 ft. in diameter (20ft from top to bottom) that acts as a slow spell for a duration of 6 combat rounds (saving throw negates). Copper dragons have a 60% chance of being able to talk; talking copper dragons have a 10% chance of being able to cast 1d4 first level magic-user spells and 1d2 second level magic-user spells.

#### Dungeon Dragon (Draco Carcer Dominus)

The dungeon dragon is a rare dragon race that delights in building intricate underground dungeons and mazes in which to ensnare would-be-delvers. A dungeon dragon is approximately 15 feet long, with a long serpentine neck, small atrophied wings, and glistening scales. Two small horns dominate its triangular head. Its body is gray in color, with scales tipped in flecks of gold and green. Its eyes are rounded and gold or gray. A dungeon dragon spits a blast of warm mist in a 100-foot line or a 50-foot cone that causes confusion.

#### Faerie Dragon (Draco Fraudatio Minimus)

The faerie dragon is a tiny beast with delicate and brightly colored butterfly wings and a long, thin prehensile tail. Its scales are smooth and range in color from red to purple, with all colors of the spectrum falling in between. Its eyes are bluish-green, and its backward curving horns are silver with gold flecks. Faerie dragons are fey members of the dragon family and are believed to be distant cousins of the pseudodragon. Female faerie dragons have a golden sheen to their coloring while males have a silver sheen. Faerie dragons love to play pranks on passersby and employ their spells to this end. Some faerie dragons spend months on end preparing for the day they can unleash their single grand practical joke or prank. Faerie dragons avoid combat and only attack if cornered or if their lair or young are in immediate danger. A faerie dragon attacks with its breath weapon, spells, and bite.

The faerie dragon’s breath weapon is a cone 5 feet long and 5 feet wide at the base. Those within the cone must pass a saving throw or or wander aimlessly in a state of euphoric bliss for 2d6 rounds (similar to a *confusion* effect). The faerie dragon can emit its breath weapon three times per day.

A faerie dragon can replicate magic-user (65% chance) or druid spells (35% chance) as a 4th level spell caster. A faerie dragon can become invisible at will and remain invisible even while attacking. This effect can be dispelled, but the faerie dragon can create it again on its next turn.

#### Gold Dragon

Gold dragons are the noble wyrms of story and song. They can breathe either a cloud of poisonous gas, 50 feet in diameter (a successful saving throw indicates half damage) or they can breathe fire in a cone-shape 90 feet long and roughly 30 feet wide at the base. Gold dragons have a 100% chance of being able to talk and a 25% chance of being able to cast Magic-User spells: 1d4 first-level, 1d3 second-level, 1d2 third-level, and 1 fourth-level spell.

#### Mist Dragon (Draco Nebulos Terra)

Mist dragons are relatively passive and reclusive, preferring to spend their time away from most other folk, including other mist dragons. Mist dragons make their lairs near large sources of water such as waterfalls, lakes, and seashores. A mist dragon resembles a gold dragon in shape and size. Its scales are shiny-blue white as a hatchling and gradually darken to a blue-gray color with metallic silver splotches. It possesses no visible wings.

A mist dragon can breathe a cloud of scalding vapor 20 feet in diameter up to three times per day. In still air, the vapor lingers for 1d4 rounds; on the second round, the vapor condenses into a heated smothering fog that deals 2d6 points of damage to creatures each round they remain in the area (saving throw for half damage) and additionally causes blindness (as the spell) as long as they remain within in the cloud and for 1d4+2 rounds after they leave the area.

A mist dragon can assume a mist form at will. This ability is as the *gaseous form* spell, but the mist dragon can remain in its mist form indefinitely and has a fly speed of 21 with perfect maneuverability. The mist dragon can use its spells in mist form, but not its physical attacks or breath weapon.

Twice per day, an adult or older mist dragon can create a maximum of 81 cubic feet of water as per the *create water* spell. It can also cast the following spells: *Control winds* (3/day), *lower water* (2/day), *obscuring mist* (2/day) and *part water* (2/day)

Mist dragons can breathe underwater indefinitely and can freely use their breath weapon, spells, and other abilities while submerged.

#### Red Dragon

Red dragons are the fire-breathing wyrms of legend. They breathe fire in a cone-shape 90 feet long and roughly 30 ft wide at the base. Red dragons have a 75% chance of being able to talk; talking red dragons have a 20% chance of being able to cast 1d4 first level Magic-User spells, 1d3 second level Magic-User spells, and 1d2 third level Magic-User spells.

#### Silver Dragon

Silver dragons are active servants of law/good; although they do not necessarily pursue this goal by assisting humankind, most would protect human settlements and civilized regions in the face of serious threats. They have the ability to polymorph themselves into human and animal forms. Silver dragons can either breath a cone of cold (70ft long, to a width of 30ft) or exhale a cloud of paralytic gas 50 ft. in diameter and 20ft from ground to top (duration 3d6 turns, saving throw negates). Silver dragons have an 80% chance of being able to talk; talking silver dragons have a 20% chance of being able to cast 1d4 first level magic-user spells, 1d3 second level magic-user spells, and 1d2 third level magic-user spells. These dragons range in size from 9 to 11 hit dice.

#### Smoke Dragon (Draco Fumo Suffoco)

Smoke dragons are small, 3-foot long, black dragons with grayish underbellies and are often mistaken for immature black dragons because of their dark colored scales. Smoke dragons have smoke-gray talons and red-tinged wings. Their eyes are gray or, in some rare instances, blue. Small under-curved horns protrude from their heads and their serpentine tails are about 5 feet long. Smoke dragons spit a cone of smoke up to 20 feet that causes opponents to choke and cough (save avoids). Once per day, a smoke dragon can assume a smoky form (similar to *gaseous form*).

#### White Dragon

White dragons are usually found in cold regions, where they camouflage themselves in ice and snow, lying in wait for prey. They breathe a cone of intensely cold air and frost, with a length of 70 ft and a base of 30 ft. White dragons are not able to talk or cast spells.

#### Wrath Dragon (Draco Sanctus Benevolentia)

A wrath dragon is 30 feet long and weighs about 30,000 pounds. It has a serpentine neck and glittering silver scales. They breathe holy fire in a cone-shape 90 feet long and roughly 30 feet wide at the base. Wrath dragons have 75% chance of being able to talk; talking wrath dragons have a 50% chance of being able to cast spells as a 6th-level Cleric. They can turn undead as an 8th-level Cleric.

### Dragon Horse

This creature resembles a horse with a smooth coat of scintillating blue hues that seem to flicker and wash over its body in waves as it gallops through the air. Its deep sky blue hooves do not touch the ground as it moves. The mane and tail of a dragon horse is of purest white and flows out behind it in an elegant cascade. The name “dragon horse” is something of a misnomer, as these creatures have no relation to true dragons. They are, in fact, more closely related to the noble ki-rin. Dragon horses are creatures originally from the Elemental Plane of Air that have decided, for reasons unknown to anyone but themselves, to reside more or less permanently in the Material Plane. Dragon horses visit the Elemental Plane of Air frequently, however.

Dragon horses are solitary creatures, but a mated pair will often remain together to raise their young. They have no need or desire for material possessions and so keep no treasure. Dragon horses are highly prized as steeds, but they are notoriously difficult to train. They have a very free spirit and do not tolerate captivity, thus only juvenile dragon horses have any chance of being tamed mounts. A captive foal can be raised only by a lawful being and doing so requires 10 years and a significant investment of time.

Three times per day, a dragon horse can create one of the following effects in a 30-foot cone: *cone of cold* (8 dice), *obscuring mist* or gust of wind capable of knocking weak or small creatures down if they fail a saving throw, a imposing a -5 penalty to ranged attacks while it continues.

A dragon horse can enter the Ethereal Plane, Astral Plane, Elemental Plane of Air, or the Material Plane. This ability transports the dragon horse and up to two other creatures, provided they are on its back.

- Dragon Horse: **HD** 8; **AC** -1 \[20\]; **Atk** 2 hooves (1d8); **Move** 30/60 (flying); **Save** 8; **AL** L; **CL/XP** 12/2000; **Special**: Breath weapon, keen vision, limited empathy, magic resistance (30%), never surprised, sense alignment

### Dragon Turtle

These shell-backed monsters breathe scalding steam in a cone-shape 90 feet long and roughly 30 ft wide at the base, inflicting as many hit points of damage as the monster has (when at full hp). Dragon turtles have a 75% chance of being able to talk, and these have a 20% chance of being able to cast 1d4 first level Magic-User spells, 1d3 second level Magic-User spells, and 1d2 third level Magic-User spells. A dragon turtle that rises beneath all but the largest ship can lift it, possibly making it capsize (roughly 50%).

- Dragon Turtle: **HD** 11; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d8), 1 bite (3d10); **Move** 3 (Swim 9); **Save** 4; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 13/2300; **Special**: Break ships, breath weapon (steam).

### Dragonfly, Giant

Giant dragonflies appear as normal dragonflies about 5 feet long. Their skin glitters in the sunlight and, if it can be removed and preserved, brings a very good price on the market. Giant dragonflies are dangerous predators and hunt humans and other humanoids as prey. A giant dragonfly is very aggressive and hunts warm-blooded creatures fearlessly. It attacks until either it or its prey is dead.

- Dragonfly: **HD** 7; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** Bite (1d8); **Move** 9/30 (flying); **Save** 9; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: None

### Dragonne

These creatures resemble a cross between a lion and a dragon, for they have a scaled dragon’s body (smaller than a dragon’s, though) with a great mane of flowing hair. The head is leonine in shape, but has reptilian scales. They do not normally have a breath weapon, but dragonnes have a tremendous roar. Anyone hearing the roar must save or be weakened (-1 to all attacks) for 1 turn.

- Dragonne: **HD** 9; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d6), 1 bite (2d6+1); **Move** 18 (Fly 9); **Save** 6; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 10/1400; **Special**: Roar.

### Dragonnel

Dragonnels are believed to be either related to dragons or an abominal crossbreed of dragon and pteranodon, as they share the physical characteristics of both those monsters. Dragonnels are semi-intelligent and use this ability to their advantage when hunting or stalking prey. Dragonnels are fierce hunters, though some have been trained by evil humanoids as mounts and guardians. A typical dragonnel is about 25 feet long. It is thought that dragonnels speak or at least understand Common. A solitary dragonnel is usually either hunting or returning to its lair from hunting, while more than one dragonnel usually indicates a mated pair or family. In such a case, all dragonnels attack in concert with one another and usually fight to the death.

A dragonnel requires training before it can bear a rider in combat. To be trained, a dragonnel must have a friendly attitude toward the trainer. Training a friendly dragonnel requires six weeks of work by an animal trainer. Riding a dragonnel requires an exotic saddle. A dragonnel can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless he or she succeeds on a saving throw. Dragonnels can carry up to 1,000 pounds without reducing their movement rate, up to 2,000 pounds at half their movement rate and 3,000 pounds at a third of their movement rate.

Dragonnel eggs are worth 4,500 gp apiece on the open market, while young are worth 9,000 gp each. Professional trainers charge 1,500 gp to rear or train a dragonnel.

- Dragonnel: **HD** 8; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d8), bite (2d6); **Move** 15/30 (flying); **Save** 9; **AL** N (with Chaotic tendencies); **CL/XP** 9/1100; **Special**: None

### Dragonship

A dragonship is an animated sailing vessel—essentially a massive wood golem in the form of a longship. It is identical to a longship in every way except that it is only 20 feet long. It has a standard square-rigged sail, and 10 oars (5 on each side). The front of the ship sports a great wooden dragon-like figurehead. It has a near perfect knowledge of local sea charts and navigation routes. It can be told a destination and it will sail there by the quickest route possible. As a sailing vessel a dragonship has a crew of 30 and can carry up to 35 tons of cargo. At will, a dragonship can cause winds to fill its sails to carry it along. Three times a day, a dragonship can breathe a line of fire up to 30 feet that does 8d6 points of damage (save for half). A dragonship is vulnerable to fire, and takes one-and-a-half times damage from fire-based spells. No other magic harms a dragonship.

- Dragonship: **HD** 20; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 4 slams (2d6+2) and 1 bite (1d8+2); **Move** 18 (swim); **Save** 3; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 23/5300; **Special**: Breath weapon, vulnerable to fire, winds, immune to magic

### Drake, Fire

Fire drakes look like small dragons with translucent scales of mottled mauve and burgundy, black wings and crimson eyes. Heat and steam rises from the dragon’s body. Fire drakes lair in caves and caverns deep within the hills and mountains. Fire drakes are carnivorous creatures and very territorial, fighting other drakes that move into their area. They are tolerant of other fire drakes, but view them with suspicion. On occasion, a mated pair is encountered, but only in the late summer months or early autumn.

A fire drake can spit a cone of fire to a range of 40 feet five times per day. Creatures in the cone suffer 2d8 points of damage (saving throw for half damage). A fire drake’s blood is highly flammable and ignites in a burst of flame upon contact with the air. A creature that makes a successful attack with an edged or pointed weapon (including natural weapons like claws) against a fire drake must succeed on a saving throw or take 1d3 points of damage from the splashing blood.

**Fire Drake Blood**

The blood of a fire drake can be sealed in an airtight container and used as a firebomb, equivalent to a burning flask of oil. It can also be used to create temporary flaming weapons. A weapon coated with fire drake’s blood inflicts an additional 1d6 points of damage with each hit for 1d4 rounds.

- Drake, Fire: **HD** 4; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** Bite (1d6); **Move** 9/30 (flying); **Save** 13; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 6/400; **Special**: Breath weapon, pyrophoric blood, resistance to fire (50%)

### Drake, Ice

Ice drakes look like small, immature white dragons with icy white scales and sapphire eyes. Ice drakes are found in cold mountainous caves and caverns. Most encounters are with a solitary drake. Only in the winter months is it common to find a mated pair or family. An ice drake can spit a cone of freezing air to a range of 40 feet five times per day. Those in the cone suffer 2d8 points of cold damage (saving throw for half damage).

Ice drakes can cast the spells *fear* and *sleep*, each twice per day. Twice per day, an ice drake can assume the shape of a young white dragon as a standard action. It can remain in this shape for up to 2 hours at a time and while in this shape has the statistics of a 6 HD white dragon of age category 2. It retains its own ability to cast spells, loses its own breath weapon and does not gain the white dragon’s breath weapon.

- Drake, Ice: **HD** 3; **AC** 1 \[18\]; **Atk** Bite (1d6), 2 claws (1d4); **Move** 9/24 (flying); **Save** 14; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 7/600; **Special**: Breath weapon, spells, alternate form, immune to cold, double damage from fire, magic resistance (40%)

### Drake, Salt

Salt drakes resemble blue dragons with mottled black wings and crimson eyes. They are found in warm, arid climates such as deserts or salt flats. Salt drakes are omnivorous creatures and very territorial, even fighting among themselves to protect their domains. Most encounters are with a solitary drake. Only in the midsummer months is it common to find a mated pair or family. A salt drake’s scales range from dull blue to midnight blue, and it is often mistaken for a young blue dragon. Salt drakes range from 8 feet to 30 feet long. Though difficult to train, salt drakes are favored as mounts by goblins, gnolls, and hobgoblins. A salt drake’s primary diet consists of large quantities of salt. This diet enables the drake to spew salt at its opponents five times per day. This blast of salt takes the form of a 60-foot cone that deals 3d6 points of damage (saving throw for half damage) from the grit and dessication.

- Drake, Salt: **HD** 11; **AC** 1 \[18\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d8), bite (2d6); **Move** 15/60 (flying); **Save** 4; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 13/2300; **Special**: Spit salt, regenerate 2 hp/round

### Drake, Splinter

A splinter drake is a wingless dragon made from wood. They are about 12 feet long and weigh around 800 pounds (24 points of damage). They breathe a blast of thorns in a cone-shape 40 feet long and 20 feet wide at the base. A splinter drake can also fire a volley of thorns in a 60-foot-line that deals 3d6 points of damage.

- Drake, Splinter: **HD** 8; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d8), bite (1d8); **Move** 12; **Save** 8; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 9/1100; **Special**: Breathe thorns, thorn volley

### Draug (Undead Captain)

The draug is the vengeful spirit of a ship’s captain who died at sea, thus being denied a proper burial. If an entire ship sinks at sea with the loss of all hands, the ship itself and its entire crew may return as ghostly wanderers. The captain usually rises as a draug and his crew rises as brine zombies (see that entry). A draug looks as it did in life, wearing the same clothes and bearing the same possessions it held at the moment of death. The arrival of a draug is often taken as a death portent, for even if it does not attack, some dire circumstance is likely to befall the witness. A draug often acts as a death token, rising out of the sea and staring at or pointing a bony finger at a sailor fated to drown. Once per day, a draug can summon inclement weather to harass its opponents. The effects are felt immediately (i.e., there is no gradual shift in the weather). Otherwise, this ability is identical to the *control weather* spell. A draug has full control over its vessel (wind notwithstanding) so long as it remains at the wheel or within 20 feet of the helmsman. Should it leave the area, its ship meanders in a random direction until the draug regains control.

When a ship sinks beneath the waves, it and its entire crew may return as ghostly wanderers, especially if the captain and crew had a less than scrupulous profession (as pirates, for example). A sunken ship of this nature may undergo a transformation from the evil surrounding it. When this happens, the ship rises from the deep, piloted by a draug and manned by skeletons, brine zombies, zombies, and lacedons. The ship appears as it did at the time of its demise. The sails are tattered and the decks covered with seaweed. When a draug is at the helm, the “ghost ship” gains several powers. Regardless of the condition of the hull, a draug-piloted ship remains afloat in any weather conditions. It is not affected by wind of any type (though the draug can still use the wind to maneuver and sail the ship) and can even sail against gale-force winds. Strong waves may toss the ship about, but will not capsize it as a result. A draug ship is so waterlogged that it is completely immune to all fire effects. A draug can maneuver his ship to leave the waves and take to the air as long as the draug remains on board. This functions as the *fly* spell cast by a magic-user with a caster level equal to the draug’s HD.

- Draug: **HD** 6; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** Cutlass (1d6) or 2 claws (1d4); **Move** 12/12 (swimming); **Save** 11; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: Call storm, control ship, resistance to fire (50%)

### Draug (Wolf-Bear Folk)

The Draug are a race of 8ft tall, bear-like humanoids with wolf-like heads and tails. They are brave warriors and strong drinkers, and their shield-lined longhouses resound to boasting and merriment. The “wolf-bear folk” fight with spear, axe, dagger, or broad sword, and gain +2 to hit and damage due to their great strength. Any treasure will be in the form of hack-silver jewelry, weapons and shields of fine craftsmanship and exquisite decoration, and kegs of mead. Suggestions they were created by the same eccentric wizard responsible for the Owl Bear will be met with howls of laughter, and an overflowing tankard of mead. *(Author: Scott Wylie Roberts, "Myrystyr").*

- Draug: **HD** 3+3; **AC** 7 \[12\] or with shield 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 1 weapon (1d8+2); **Move** 12; **Save** 14; **AL** N or L; **CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**: +2 to hit.

### Dream Spectre (Nightmare Creature)

Dream specters are incorporeal creatures that look like spectres. They are not undead, however. Their claw attack puts victims into an enchanted slumber (saving throw avoids). One creature per round seeing a dream specter must save or be reduced to 1 hit point. Unless healed, the victim dies in the next round. Dream specters can also enter the dreams of sleeping creatures within 100 feet. A dream is powerless in daylight.

- Dream Spectre: **HD** 8; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 1 claw (1d4 + sleep); **Move** 14 (flying); **Save** 8; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 10/1400; **Special**: enchanted slumber, death gaze, +1 magic weapon to hit

### Drelb (Haunting Custodian)

Drelbs are energy creatures that make their home on the Negative Energy Plane. They appear as spectral figures of darkness with no discernable features save their eyes - two small pinpoints of light. They are summoned to the Material Plane by evil spellcasters who task them with the duty of guarding treasure or secret places to be left alone. Hence, they are sometimes referred to as haunting custodians. Drelbs are not undead and cannot be turned, though they sometimes feign being affected. A living creature touched by a drelb immediately drops anything it is holding and falls prone, shivering for 1 round. There is no save against this attack.

A drelb can rapidly diminish its form while it advances forward. To the onlooker, it appears as if the drelb is retreating. Creatures succeeding on a saving throw see through this illusion; otherwise, the drelb advances into melee range and its opponent is considered surprised for the first round of comnbat with the drelb.

A drelb can imitate any mind-affecting spell used within 30 feet of it as though a 5th level spellcaster. Further, any such spell that directly targets a drelb is reflected back on the attacker with full effect.

- Drelb: **HD** 5; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** Incorporeal touch (1d4 plus nether chill); **Move** 9/9 (flying); **Save** 12; **AL** N (Chaotic tendencies); **CL/XP** 7/600; **Special**: +1 or better weapon to hit, double damage from silver weapons, immune to mind-affecting spells and abilities

### Drider

Driders are spider-centaurs: the body is that of a massive spider, but the torso is that of a delicate human-like person.

Driders have the following innate magical abilities, usable once per day: create lantern-like lights at a range of 60ft*, darkness 15-ft. radius, detect magic,* and *levitate*. In addition, driders are spellcasters. Male driders are magic-users (4/3/2/1), and females are clerics (2/2/2/1/1).

- Drider: **HD** 7; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 1 weapon (1d8); **Move** 18; **Save** 9; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 9/1100; **Special**: Spells, magical abilities.

### Drow

The drow are dark elves, denizens of the Under Realms, dwellers in darkness. They have coal-black skin and white hair. These creatures of chaos despise the surface-dwelling servants of Law, and would certainly choose to eradicate them if the drow themselves did not dislike sunlight. All attacks made by drow in sunlight, or in even magical light, will be made at a penalty of -2.

All drow have the following spell-like powers: *darkness 15-ft. radius*, ability to limn a target in faint light at a range of 60ft (all have +1 to hit the victim), and the ability to create lantern-like lights at a range of 60ft.

All drow wear +1 chain mail and carry +1 longswords. They wear cloaks and boots that make them difficult to see and hear (75% chance to surprise). All of this equipment will decay in sunlight, becoming useless after 2d6 days of normal exposure. Roughly half of normal drow will also be carrying hand-crossbows that fire poison darts (1d3 damage, sleep poison save at -4).

Drow are capable of advancing in level, and their leaders may be considerably more dangerous than the normal 2HD (Ftr2) drow. Male drow may have magic-user levels up to 12, and fighter levels up to 7. Female drow may have fighter levels up to 9, and magic –user or cleric levels up to 12 or 18 respectively. These higher-level leaders may be carrying swords with greater than a +1 bonus, shields with a magical bonus, and/or wearing chain mail with greater than a +1 bonus.

- Drider: **HD** 2; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** +1 longsword (1d8+1); **Move** 12; **Save** 14; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: 50% magic resistance, +2 on all saving throws, lights, darkness 15-ft, 1 in 8 to-be-surprised chance.

### Dryad

Dryads are beautiful female tree spirits who do not venture far from their home trees. They can cast (as a native magical power) a strong charm that operates as a *Charm Person* spell with a -2 penalty to the saving throw. Those who are charmed seldom return, or might be kept for a hundred years and a day within the dryad’s tree.

- Dryad: **HD** 2; **AC** 9 \[10\]; **Atk** 1 wooden dagger (1d4); **Move** 12; **Save** 16; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**: Charm person (-2 save).

### Duergar

The duergar, often called the “dark dwarves,” are foul-tempered creatures that loathe intruders to their underground realms—but not nearly as much as they do their kinfolk closer to the surface. Duergar dwell in communities deep underground, and appear as darker, more twisted versions of normal dwarves. Their skin is a dull gray, as though rubbed with dust or ash, but this is a natural coloration that better allows them to blend with their underground surroundings. They are a race of slavers, but while non-dwarven prisoners are usually put to backbreaking work, dwarves are generally slain on the spot.

Duergar can turn invisible once per day, and can also double their size once per day (this allows the duergar to attack as a 4HD creature, and heals 50% of any damage the duergar had taken prior to the change). Duergar leaders gain +2 to hit rather than an increase in hit dice.

- Duergar: **HD** 1+2; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 1 weapon (1d8); **Move** 9; **Save** 18; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**: +4 save vs. magic, immune to illusions, invisibility, enlarge.

### Dust Digger

Dust diggers are nocturnal desert carnivores about 10 feet in diameter. They resemble brown starfish with five long tentacles ringing a central maw lined with sharpened teeth and fangs. The creature spends most of its life buried under sand and dirt, waiting for potential prey to wander too close or actually wander over the area where a dust digger is buried. A dust digger inflates its body with air, buries itself under a thin lair of sand or dirt, and waits for its prey to pass nearby. When a living creature walks over a dust digger, the creature deflates its body and folds its arms around the victim, attempting to shove the prey into its mouth.

A dust digger can try to swallow a grabbed opponent by making a successful attack. Once inside the dust digger’s interior, the opponent takes 2d6 points of damage per round from the digestive fluids and the squeezing movement of the stomach. A swallowed creature can climb out of the dust digger with a successful saving throw made at a -3 penalty. This returns it to the creature’s maw, where another successful saving throw is needed to get free.

A dust digger can glide through sand, loose soil, or almost any sort of loosely packed earth as easily as a fish swims through water. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other signs of its presence. A *move earth* spell cast on an area containing a burrowing dust digger flings the dust digger back 30 feet, stunning the creature for 1 round unless it succeeds on a saving throw.

- Dust Digger: **HD** 4; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 5 tentacles (1d6); **Move** 6/6 (burrowing); **Save** 13; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 6/400; **Special**: Sinkhole, swallow whole

### Dwarf

Statistics above are for the common Dwarf with no particular unusual characteristics. A dwarf-at-arms would usually have a full 8 hit points, reflecting skill and general toughness. Stronger Dwarfs (sergeants-at-arms, for example) might have more hit dice or unusual bonuses to hit, or even magical abilities if such is possible (Norse myths are a good example of this.) Do not bother to treat more-powerful NPC dwarfs as Fighters or other character types; just assign the right number of hit dice and abilities (if any) and keep moving along with the fantasy.

- Dwarf: **HD** 1; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 1 weapon (1d8); **Move** 6; **Save** 17; **AL** L; **CL/XP** 1/15; **Special**: Detect attributes of stonework.

### Dwelver

Dwelvers were once a race of dwarves that followed their greed to the elemental plane of earth to mine it for its riches. Throughout the millennia they slowly began to change into the very substances they sought. While still resembling dwarves in form, they are made of stone, ores and gems. Dwelvers are malevolent and greedy and will defend their claims against all comers. They now exist only to mine worlds of their mineral resources, which they use to create more of their race. Groups of Dwelvers are able to summon Earth Elementals, which will serve them faithfully. At least eight Dwelvers are needed to summon an 8 hit dice Earth Elemental, twelve for one of 12 hit dice and sixteen to summon one of 16 hit dice. It is also likely Dwelvers are able to employ other earthen magics. *(Author: The Lizard of Oz).*

- Dwelver: **HD** 4 +2 ; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 1 weapon or strike (1d8); **Move** 6 ; **Save** 13; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Collective Summoning.

### Eagle, Giant

Giant eagles are just large enough to carry a human rider. Some varieties of the breed may be intelligent, and truly unusual specimens might even be capable of casting spells or using other magical powers. These unusual breeds of giant eagle might be aligned with Law rather than Neutrality. Because giant eagles can be tamed as mounts, their eggs and fledglings are worth considerable amounts of gold (500+gp).

- Giant Eagle: **HD** 4; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 2 talons (1d4), 1 bite (1d8); **Move** 3 (Fly 24); **Save** 13; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: None.

### Ear Seeker

Ear seekers are small maggot-like creatures, white or brown in color. They are found lairing in rotting wood or similar organic materials. If the check fails, the ear seekers have contacted the creature and move toward any warm place on the creature (favoring places such as the ears) in which to lay their eggs. Once an ear seeker enters a warm place, it lays 2d8 eggs before dying. In 4d6 hours, the eggs hatch and the larvae devour the surrounding flesh, dealing 2d6 points of damage to the host each round thereafter. At 0 hit points, the host dies and the ear seekers crawl out to find a new host. A *cure disease* spell kills all ear seekers and any unhatched eggs.

**Ear Seeker** from the [Tome of Horrors Complete](http://shop.d20pfsrd.com/products/sw-the-tome-of-horrors-complete), Copyright 2011, Necromancer Games, Inc., published and distributed by Frog God Games; Authors Scott Greene and Erica Balsley, based on original material by Gary Gygax.

### Eblis

The eblis are a semi-civilized society of birdmen that make their homes in desolate swamps and marshes. They rarely have interactions with other races, preferring the company of their own kind and the serenity of their marshland homes. An eblis is a large bird that strongly resembles a stork — so much so that eblis are often called “stork men.” An eblis stands about 8 feet tall, and the neck is extremely long and snake-like and is unnaturally flexible and capable of blindingly fast movements. An eblis’ beak is long, sharp, and deadly. A male eblis has gray-brown feathers with reddish patches on its head, while a female lacks the red patch. Eblis speak their own language of clicks and chatters and some speak Common. Each eblis flock has one individual capable of using arcane magic. A spellcasting eblis has 1d6 spells, each spell usable once per day. Each spell is cast as though a 4th level magic-user.

**1d6 Spell**
**1***ESP*
**2***Mirror image*
**3***Obscuring mist*
**4***Phantasmal force*
**5***Fear*
**6***Invisibility*

- Eblis: **HD** 4; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** Beak (1d6); **Move** 12 (Fly 12); **Save** 13; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 6/400; **Special**: Spells, fire resistance (50%)

### Ectoplasm (Ghost Ooze)

This incorporeal ooze resembles a faintly glowing, billowing cloud. Ectoplasms are not undead. The pseudopod attack of an ectoplasm imposes a -1 cumulative to-hit penalty to attack and damage with each strike. It does an additional 1 point of damage against undead.

- Ectoplasm: **HD** 7; **AC** 10 \[9\]; **Atk** 1 pseudopod (1d8 + weakness); **Move** 6 (flying); **Save** 9; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 10/1400; **Special**: +1 or better magic weapon required to hit

### Eel, Giant

These statistics are for giant eels about ten feet in length. Larger eels would have correspondingly greater hit dice. The electric shock generated by a giant electric eel would cause 3d6 points of damage in the surrounding water, with no saving throw. See also, “Lampreys,” which are also eels.

- Giant Electric Eel: **HD** 2; **AC** 8 \[11\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d3); **Move** 0 (Swim 9); **Save** 16; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: Electric shock.
- Giant Moray Eel: **HD** 4; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 1 bite (2d6); **Move** 0 (Swim 9); **Save** 13; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: None.

### Efreeti

Efreet are a type of genie, associated with fire (in contrast to the djinn, who have powers over the air). Efreet can carry up to 1000 pounds of weight, and under the right circumstances they can be forced to serve as a slave until they figure out how to free themselves. An efreeti can create a wall of fire (per the spell). They appear as giant humans with cruel features, their skin flickering with flames.

- Efreeti: **HD** 10; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 1 fist or sword (1d8+5); **Move** 9 (Fly 24); **Save** 5; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 12/2000; **Special**: Wall of fire.

### Elementals

Elementals are living manifestations of the basic forms of matter: earth, air, fire, and water. They are usually summoned from their native planes of existence to do the bidding of a powerful wizard. These beings can also be “chained” within objects or structures to give the objects magical properties. Elementals are barely intelligent at all, but they are as powerful as the forces of nature that they actually are.

#### Air Elemental

Air elementals can turn into a whirlwind of air with a diameter of 30 ft, hurling any creature of 1 HD or less for great distances (and almost certainly killing them). These elemental whirlwinds are approximately 100 ft. in height.

- Air Elemental (8 HD): **HD** 8; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 1 strike (2d8); **Move** (Fly 36); **Save** 8; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 9/1100; **Special**: Whirlwind, immune to non-magic weapons.
- Air Elemental (12 HD): **HD** 12; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 1 strike (2d8); **Move** (Fly 36); **Save** 3; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 13/2300; **Special**: Whirlwind, immune to non-magic weapons.
- Air Elemental (16 HD): **HD** 16; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 1 strike (2d8); **Move** (Fly 36); **Save** 3; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 17/3500; **Special**: Whirlwind, immune to non-magic weapons.

#### Earth Elemental

Earth elementals are hulking man-shapes of rock and earth. They batter opponents with their great fists, although damage is reduced by 1d6 if the opponent is not standing upon earth or rock. Earth elementals can tear apart stone structures, able to rip down even a castle wall in a matter of 1d4+4 rounds (minutes).

- Earth Elemental (8 HD): **HD** 8; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 1 strike (4d8); **Move** 6; **Save** 8; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 9/1100; **Special**: Tear down stonework, immune to non-magic weapons.
- Earth Elemental (12 HD): **HD** 12; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 1 strike (4d8); **Move** 6; **Save** 3; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 13/2300; **Special**: Tear down stonework, immune to non-magic weapons.
- Earth Elemental (16 HD): **HD** 16; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 1 strike (4d8); **Move** 6; **Save** 3; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 17/3400; **Special**: Tear down stonework, immune to non-magic weapons.

#### Fire Elemental

Fire elementals are formless masses of flame, perhaps with a vaguely human shape. Their attacks cause flammable materials (including wood) to ignite if the material fails a saving throw (as determined by the Referee).

- Fire Elemental (8 HD): **HD** 8; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 1 strike (3d8); **Move** 12; **Save** 8; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 9/1100; **Special**: Ignite materials, immune to non-magic weapons.
- Fire Elemental (12 HD): **HD** 12; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 1 strike (3d8); **Move** 12; **Save** 3; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 13/2300; **Special**: Ignite materials, immune to non-magic weapons.
- Fire Elemental (16 HD): **HD** 16; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 1 strike (3d8); **Move** 12; **Save** 3; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 17/3400; **Special**: Ignite materials, immune to non-magic weapons.

#### Gravity Elemental

Gravity elementals are circular regions of absolute blackness that attack by hurling objects using telekinesis. They warp and manipulate gravity within 20 feet of them, giving arrows and other missile attacks a -6 to-hit penalty. Spells such as magic missile ignore this warped gravity field and strike true.

- Gravity Elemental (8 HD): **HD** 8; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** Strike (2d8); **Move** (Fly 36); **Save** 8; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 9/1100; **Special**: telekinesis
- Gravity Elemental (12 HD): **HD** 12; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** Strike (2d8); **Move** (Fly 36); **Save** 3; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 13/2300; **Special**: telekinesis
- Gravity Elemental (16 HD): **HD** 16; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** Strike (2d8); **Move** (Fly 36); **Save** 3; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 17/3500; **Special**: telekinesis

#### Negative Energy Elemental

A negative energy elemental appears as a sphere of translucent gray energy with small motes of light winking in and out of existence. The touch of a negative energy elemental drains 1 level with each hit. When slain, a negative energy elemental detonates in a 30-foot-radius blast that deals 1d6 points of damage per 2 HD.

- Negative Energy Elemental (8 HD): **HD** 8; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** Strike (1d8 + energy drain); **Move** (Fly 36); **Save** 8; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 9/1100; **Special**: Level drain (1 level with hit)
- Negative Energy Elemental (12 HD): **HD** 12; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** Strike (1d8 + energy drain); **Move** (Fly 36); **Save** 3; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 13/2300; **Special**: Level drain (1 level with hit)
- Negative Energy Elemental (16 HD): **HD** 16; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** Strike (1d8 + energy drain); **Move** (Fly 36); **Save** 3; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 17/3500; **Special**: Level drain (1 level with hit)

#### Positive Energy Elemental

A positive energy elemental appears as a shimmering sphere of brilliant white energy with small motes of light winking in and out of existence. Its attacks imbue bonus hit points upon targets that last up to one hour. A creature reaching double its normal hit points explodes. When slain, a positive energy elemental detonates in a 30-foot-radius blast that heals 1d6 points of damage per 2 HD.

- Positive Energy Elemental (8 HD): **HD** 8; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** Strike (1d6 healing); **Move** (Fly 36); **Save** 8; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 9/1100; **Special**: Positive energy burst
- Positive Energy Elemental (12 HD): **HD** 12; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** Strike (1d6 healing); **Move** (Fly 36); **Save** 3; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 13/2300; **Special**: Positive energy burst

#### Psionic Elemental

Psionic elementals appear as a dark, semi-translucent clouds of swirling vapor. They have their origin on a plane composed entirely of psionic matter and seldom venture from their home except when summoned by a spellcaster. It is unknown whether psionic elementals can speak; all communication with these creatures thus far has been through telepathy. Looking closely at a psionic elemental’s form reveals two small pinpoints and a mouth formed of solid bits of matter swirling in the elemental’s form.

Psionic elementals can cast the following spells: d*imension door*, *esp*, *magic missile* (3/day) and *suggestion* (3/day). Large psionic elementals can also use *telekinesis* at will. They enjoy a +2 bonus to saving throws against mind-controlling or affecting spells or abilities.

By folding the dimensions around its body, a psionic elemental can automatically deflect one attack per round directed against it back upon the attacker. The attacker takes full damage just as if he had hit the psionic elemental (including any special effects of the attack). Spells can be reflected using this power, but only those that specifically target the elemental. Area of effect spells are not reflected and have full effect on the psionic elemental.

- Psionic Elemental (8 HD): **HD** 8; **AC** 1 \[18\]; **Atk** Strike (2d6); **Move** (Fly 24); **Save** 8; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 12/2000; **Special**: Psionic powers, +1 or better weapon to hit, magic resistance (30%), telepathy 100 ft., warp reality
- Psionic Elemental (12 HD): **HD** 12; **AC** 1 \[18\]; **Atk** Strike (2d6); **Move** (Fly 24); **Save** 3; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 16/3200; **Special**: Psionic powers, +1 or better weapon to hit, magic resistance (30%), telepathy 100 ft., warp reality
- Psionic Elemental (16 HD): **HD** 16; **AC** 1 \[18\]; **Atk** Strike (2d6); **Move** (Fly 24); **Save** 3; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 20/4400; **Special**: Psionic powers, +1 or better weapon to hit, magic resistance (30%), telepathy 100 ft., warp reality

#### Time Elemental

Time elementals are creatures from an elemental plane most sages are unaware even exists. A time elemental is a powerful creature formed of pure time and matter such as is unknown to even the most learned of sages. It is unknown how or why time elementals enter the Material Plane, as they cannot be summoned using the standard summoning spells. Time elementals appear as formless clouds of coppery vapor or sparkling dust about 5 feet in diameter. They attack by forming misty or smoky arms from their forms and lashing at opponents or by spraying a fine mist onto their opponents so as to induce aging. Damage dealt by a time elemental’s slam attack does not heal naturally, but it can still be healed magically. A creature slain by a time elemental can only be raised through the successful casting of a *wish* spell.

Once per day, a noble time elemental can age a creature simply by touching it (this requires a melee attack that ignores one’s armor bonus to AC). If successful, the target must succeed on a saving throw or advance forward one aging step (from adulthood to middle age, from middle age to old, from old to venerable, and so on). A venerable creature affected by this ability dies and cannot be restored to life by mortal magic. Alternately, a time elemental can use its alter age ability to reduce a character’s age. A character that regresses in age does not revert to earlier mental states, retaining all memories and mental abilities. This ability does not affect a character that has died from old age. A time elemental can also use this ability to age vegetable matter 10-200 years (older or younger) or mineral matter 100-2,000 years (older or younger). Royal time elementals can use this ability twice per day.

A time elemental exists in several other dimensions at any given time. It can bring forth 1d4 of these manifestations to its current locale in order to gain multiple attacks that round. Treat each manifestation as a separate time elemental with hit points equal to the time elemental’s current hit points. A manifestation cannot use any of the spell abilities of the time elemental except foresight. A time elemental cannot have more than four manifestations present at one time. Because each manifestation is a part of the time elemental that called them, a successful attack on the time elemental or any of its manifestations deals an equal amount of damage to them all.

By making a melee attack against a foe, a noble or royal time elemental can remove that creature from the current time stream. On a failed save, the creature disappears in a flash of white energy. For a number of minutes equal to the time elemental’s Hit Dice, the displaced creature is effectively nonexistent. No form of magic, effect, or force can detect or aid such a creature. When the effect ends, the creature reappears in the same space it was in before being displaced. If the space is occupied when the creature returns, it is shunted aside to the first open space and takes no damage. A noble or royal time elemental can use this ability three times per day.

A time elemental can slip through the time stream and appear anywhere on the same plane of existence as if by teleporting. This ability transports the time elemental and up to four other creatures within a 30-foot radius. Unwilling creatures can attempt a saving throw to avoid being carried away.

Once per day, a royal time elemental can attempt to summon 1d4 common time elementals with a 70% chance of success or 1-2 noble time elementals with a 30% chance of success. Noble and royal time elementals can create an effect identical to a *time stop* spell once per day. All time elementals can see a few seconds into the future. This ability prevents it from being surprised. Time elementals are immune to all time-related spells and effects (though the *time stop* ability of the noble and royal time elementals can affect those time elementals of lesser power).

- Common Time Elemental: **HD** 12; **AC** 0 \[19\]; **Atk** 2 slams (2d6 plus cell death); **Move** (Fly 9); **Save** 3; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 20/4400; **Special**: Cell death, multi- manifestation, foresight, immunity to magic, magic resistance (40%), time jaunt, +1 or better weapon to hit

#### Water Elemental

Water elementals cannot move more than 60 ft. from a large body of water, and their damage is reduced by 1d6 if the opponent is not standing in water (or swimming, etc). These powerful beings can overturn small boats, and can overturn a ship if given 1d4+4 rounds to work at it. On water, they can attack ships, battering them to pieces within 1 hour if not prevented or distracted.

- Water Elemental (8 HD): **HD** 8; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 1 strike (3d10); **Move** 6 (Swim 18); **Save** 8; **CL/XP** 9/1100; **Special**: overturn boats, immune to non-magic weapons.
- Water Elemental (12 HD): **HD** 12; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 1 strike (3d10); **Move** 6 (Swim 18); **Save** 3; **CL/XP** 13/2300; **Special**: overturn boats, immune to non-magic weapons.
- Water Elemental (16 HD): **HD** 16; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 1 strike (3d10); **Move** 6 (Swim 18); **Save** 3; **CL/XP** 17/3500; **Special**: overturn boats, immune to non-magic weapons.

### Elemental Constructs

Elemental constructs are golems or automatons forged of one of the four basic elements—air, earth, fire, or water—bound to serve their creator. The creation of an elemental construct requires no less than five elemental spirits (of the same type) which are unwillingly bound into the form of the elemental construct.

Elemental constructs are used by powerful mages as servants, bodyguards, and assassins. An elemental construct, like any other automaton follows any order or command given to it to the best of its ability.

An elemental construct’s creator can command it if the construct is within 60 feet and can see and hear its creator. If not commanded, an elemental construct usually follows its last instruction to the best of its ability, though if attacked it returns the attack. The creator can give the elemental construct a simple command to govern its actions in his or her absence. The elemental construct’s creator can order the construct to obey the commands of another person (who might in turn place the elemental construct under someone else’s control, and so on), but the elemental construct’s creator can always resume control over his creation by commanding the elemental construct to obey him alone.

Each elemental construct appears as a humanoid creature about 9 feet tall and is composed entirely of its native element.

#### Air Elemental Construct

An air elemental construct is a 9-foot-tall semi-vaporous humanoid composed of air and mist. An air elemental construct transforms the air in a 30-foot radius around it into a forceful blast of wind and debris that deals 2d6 points of damage. *Control winds* and *control weather* spells heal an air elemental construct (1d8 per spell level). Any cold-based attack slows an air elemental construct. No other type of spell affects an air elemental construct.

- Air Elemental Construct: **HD** 90 hit points; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** Pummel (3d6) or wind blast 30 ft. radius (2d6); **Move** (Fly 36); **Save** 3; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 17/3500; **Special**: Immune to magic, +2 or better magic weapon required to hit

#### Earth Elemental Construct

An earth elemental construct is a 12-foot-tall humanoid composed of dirt and rock. An earth elemental charges opponents, dealing 2d6 points of damage with a hit. An *earthquake* spell immediately destroys an earth elemental construct. *Transmute rock to mud* and *move earth* heals an earth elemental construct (1d8 per spell level). No other type of spell affects an earth elemental construct.

- Earth Elemental Construct: **HD** 90 hit points; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** Pound (4d6) or trample (2d6); **Move** 8; **Save** 3; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 17/3500; **Special**: Immune to magic, +2 or better magic weapon required to hit

#### Fire Elemental Construct

A fire elemental construct is a 9-foot-tall humanoid composed of flame. Their attacks cause flammable materials (including wood) to ignite. A fire elemental construct launches a bolt of fire 90 feet that does 2d6 points of damage. Fire-based spells heal a fire elemental construct (1d8 per spell level). Cold-based spells do double damage to the creature. No other spells affect a fire elemental construct.

- Fire Elemental Construct: **HD** 90 hit points; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** Strike (3d6) or fire bolt (2d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 3; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 17/3500; **Special**: Immune to magic, immune to fire, +2 or better magic weapon required to hit, ignite materials

#### Water Elemental Construct

A water elemental construct is a 10-foot-tall humanoid composed entirely of water. The elemental’s slam attack engulfs opponents, and they drown in 2d4 rounds if they can’t escape the creature’s liquid form. *Create water* heals a water elemental construct (1d8 per spell level). *Lower water* instantly destroys a water elemental construct, while *part water* divides the creature into 2 equal halves. Fire-based spells do double damage. No other spell affects a water elemental construct.

- Water Elemental Construct: **HD** 90 hit points; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** Slam (3d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 3; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 17/3500; **Special**: Immune to magic, +2 or better magic weapon required to hit, engulf, drown

### Elemental Dragons

#### Air Elemental Dragon

The Elemental Plane of Air is home to many creatures: elementals, belkers, and the great djinni. Yet none are as feared as the elemental air dragons. Their great form and majestic aura strike fear into the bravest of souls. Elemental air dragons are as chaotic as their brethren (the other elemental dragons) and take joy and pride in swooping over a settlement or village and destroying it with their cyclonic powers. Watching the frightened creatures flee in terror provokes some sort of perverse excitement in these dragons. Luckily, elemental air dragons rarely enter the Material Plane. Elemental air dragons dislike cloud dragons and mist dragons and seek to slay them whenever they are encountered. The average air elemental dragon is 30 feet long and appears to be a huge dragon composed of vapor and smoke. Three times per day, an elemental air dragons can breath a cone of superheated air. The cone measures 50 feet long and 30 feet at the base and inflicts 10d8 points of damage (save for half).

By beating its wings rapidly back and forth, a hovering elemental air dragon can create a cyclone-like force of wind in a 30-foot radius around its body. This cyclone has the following effects: movement through the cyclone is one-third normal, ranged attacks suffer a -6 penalty in the area, and all non-magical unprotected flames are extinguished. Creatures in the area must succeed on a saving throw or take 3d6 points of damage each round they remain in the area. Human sized or smaller creatures in the area must succeed on a second saving throw or be knocked prone and back 1d4 x 10 feet, taking 1d6 points of nonlethal (i.e. cannot reduce hit points lower than 1) damage per 10 feet. Flying creatures are automatically grounded in this area.

Elemental air dragons can cast *control weather* once per day.

- Air Elemental Dragon: **HD** 24; **AC** -2 \[21\]; **Atk** Bite (2d10), 2 claws (2d8); **Move** 9/48 (flying); **Save** 3; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 33/8300; **Special**: Breath weapon, cyclone, spells, +2 or better weapon to hit

#### Earth Elemental Dragon

Elemental earth dragons are the strongest of the elemental dragons. Using their great stone tail or earthen claws, they can destroy almost anything in short order. The majority of their time is spent burrowing through the Elemental Plane of Earth devouring gems, minerals, and silicate life forms. On occasion, they are summoned to the Material Plane by evil (and foolish) spellcasters who usually live just long enough to regret their mistake. Elemental earth dragons are chaotic (perhaps the most chaotic of the elemental dragons in addition to being the strongest) and despise most other forms of life. They rarely associate with other creatures, though a few have been known to have dealings with the occasional earth elemental. Elemental earth dragons cannot enter water; they must burrow under it or walk around it. The average elemental earth dragon is 30 feet long and resembles a massive wyrm composed of polished stone. Its roar can be heard up to 5 miles away.

Three times per day an elemental earth dragon can breath a cone of scorched earth, 50 feet long and 30 feet wide at the base. Creatures inside this cone suffer 14d8 points of damage (save for half).

When an elemental earth dragon slays an opponent, it dehydrates the flesh with its breath weapon and pulverizes the bones. The residue is then absorbed into the dragon’s body. An assimilated creature can only be restored to life using *wish*, but even then, there is a 50% chance that such powerful magic fails.

An elemental earth dragon can hold itself so still it appears to be a statue. An observer has a 1 in 10 chance (1 in 6 for dwarves) to notice that the elemental earth dragon is really alive. In addition, an elemental earth dragon can meld its body with any stone surface large enough to accommodate its entire body.

- Earth Elemental Dragon: **HD** 24; **AC** -3 \[22\]; **Atk** Bite (2d12), 2 claws (2d8); **Move** 9/30/9 (flying/burrowing); **Save** 3; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 33/8300; **Special**: Assimilation, breath weapon, only harmed by +2 or better weapons, freeze, meld into stone

#### Fire Elemental Dragon

*This creature appears as a 30-foot long dragon composed of fire. Its eyes burn with a white-hot flame and flames lick the dragon’s great mouth as it roars. As it flies overhead, its wings send sheets of flame roaring into the sky and crashing into the ground.*

One of the most feared creatures from the Elemental Plane of Fire is the dreaded elemental fire dragon. Composed entirely of flames, these magnificent creatures fear little and are respected and feared by those that have encountered them. Elemental fire dragons are malign and vicious. They delight in killing and torturing others, especially magmin (whom they relish as a delicacy). They employ salamanders to aid them in their ventures, but once they have accomplished their goals, any survivors are devoured. Elemental fire dragons cannot enter water or any other nonflammable liquid. The typical elemental fire dragon is at least 30 feet long and looks like a sinuous dragon composed entirely of fire, with white hot eyes and gouts of smoke leaking from between its teeth.

Anyone within 60 feet of an elemental fire dragon must succeed on a saving throw or take 1d6 points of fire damage from the intense heat. Creatures attacking an elemental fire dragon unarmed or with natural weapons take 1d6 points of damage each time one of their attacks hits. Combustibles automatically catch fire if they contact an elemental fire dragon.

Three times per day an elemental fire dragon can breath a cone of elemental fire, 50 feet long and 30 feet wide at the base. This fire inflicts 16d10 points of damage (save for half).

An elemental fire dragon can hover and rapidly beat its wings causing fire to rain down on an area in a 100-foot radius. Creatures within the area must succeed on saving throw or take 2d8 points of fire damage as clothes catch fire or armor and weapons become searing hot. The damage continues for another 1d8 rounds after the attack or until the flames are extinguished. Combustibles in the area automatically catch on fire.

- Fire Elemental Dragon: **HD** 24; **AC** -5 \[24\]; **Atk** Bite (2d8 plus 2d8 fire), 2 claws (2d6 plus 2d6 fire); **Move** 15/36 (flying); **Save** 3; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 33/8300; **Special**: Breath weapon, fiery aura, rain of fire, only harmed by +3 or better weapons, immune to fire, double damage from cold

#### Water Elemental Dragon

From the Elemental Plane of Water comes the elemental water dragon. They make their homes in the deep oceans of the Material Plane and are rarely found far away from large expanses of water. An elemental water dragon is composed entirely of water and commands respect from the more intelligent sea creatures as well as those humanoids that ply their trade upon the waters. Elemental water dragons are chaotic and take great pleasure in demanding sacrifice from those that dare enter their realm. If the sacrifice placates the dragon, it lets the creature pass unabated; otherwise, it attacks with all of its might and most often destroys those that offend it or fail to appease its desires. Water dragons take great pleasure in capsizing and sinking ships. On occasion, a group of sahuagin or locathah can be found allied with an elemental water dragon, but this alliance is usually short-lived and often shaky and ends with the death of the fish men.

When submerged, an elemental water dragon is effectively invisible (1 in 12 chance to spot, 1 in 10 chance for elves) until it attacks. A submerged elemental water dragon that surfaces under a boat or ship of less than 20 feet long capsizes the vessel 95% of the time. It has a 50% chance to capsize a vessel from 20 to 60 feet long and a 20% chance to capsize one over 60 feet long.

Three times per day an elemental water dragon can breath a cone of superheated water, 50 feet long and 30 feet wide at the base. The breath weapon inflicts 14d8 points of damage (save for half).

The elemental water dragon’s touch puts out torches, campfires, exposed lanterns, and other open flames of nonmagical origin as long as they are no larger than a house fire. The creature can dispel magical fire it touches as the *dispel magic* spell. It can *part water* and *lower water* each once per day.

- Water Elemental Dragon: **HD** 24; **AC** -2 \[21\]; **Atk** Bite (2d8), 2 claws (2d6); **Move** 15/36 (flying and swimming); **Save** 3; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 33/8300; **Special**: Breath weapon, capsize, drench, spells, only harmed by +2 or better weapons, transparency

### Elephant

Trained elephants can carry a howdah upon their backs, with up to six people within. In battle, wounded elephants may become maddened and go on a rampage, ignoring all training.

- Elephant: **HD** 10; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 1 trunk (1d10), 2 gore (1d10), 2 trample (2d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 5; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 11/1700; **Special**: None.

### Elf

The example above is for a typical Elf; trained warriors would likely have the maximum 9 hit points. Obviously, Elves encountered in the course of a party’s adventuring will have a variety of powers and different attributes. The Referee will assign such powers as he sees fit, in accordance with the way he envisions elves. They might be the woodland dwellers of Tolkien’s *The Hobbit*, or the high Elves of the *Lord of the Rings*, or might be the faerie folk of Irish legend. In any case, the Referee should not bother trying to fit an idea of “advanced” Elves into the constraints of character classes—just assign their attributes to fit the concept. Non-player characters are not subject to the rules that govern building a player character; they are tools for good fantasy.

- Elf: **HD** 1+1; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 1 sword (1d8) or 2 arrows (1d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 17; **AL** L (or N); **CL/XP** 1/15; **Special**: Darkvision 60ft, 4 in 6 chance to find secret doors, immune to ghoul paralysis.

### Elusa Hound

The elusa hound appears as a powerful wolf-like dog with pale white, coarse fur (though some recent breeds have whitish-gray fur) and a short, bushy tail. Its eyes burn with a ghostly yellow glow and its teeth are ivory white. The dog is attuned to Magic-Users and can track them unerringly using its ability to detect magic at will.

- Elusa Hound: **HD** 3; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d6+1); **Move** 15; **Save** 14; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**: Detect magic

### Encephalon Gorger

An encephalon gorger is a sleek, pale-skinned humanoid standing about 7 feet tall, with long, thin arms and legs. Its hands and feet end in four digits; the two middle digits being slightly longer than the outer two. Its mouth is lined with short, needle-like teeth, with the canines being most pronounced. An encephalon gorger’s tongue is sleek and black. An encephalon gorger strikes and tears at its victims with its sharp claws. If it hits with two claws, it grabs the victim and automatic starts to mindfeed in the next round. To mindfeed, the gorger sinks its teeth into the prey’s head to drain cerebral fluid (1d6 points of damage per round). Twice per day, a gorger can give itself an adrenal boost of speed (similar to a *haste* spell). An encephalon gorger heals 3 hit points per round.

- Encephalon Gorger: **HD** 8; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d6+1); **Move** 6; **Save** 8; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 9/1100; **Special**: mindfeed, resists cold, haste, regenerate 3 hp/round

### Ethereal Shade

An ethereal shade resembles a mass of black, wispy smoke, which billows and contracts as it floats about. Ethereal Shades are undead and are thus affected by a cleric’s Turn Undead ability (treat as a Type 9 undead). At night, or in darkness, it becomes nearly invisible. The referee may require a check or saving throw to spot an ethereal shade in such conditions. Battling an ethereal shade in dimly illuminated environments incurs a -4 penalty to hit. The ethereal shade inflicts damage by use of its icy touch. Ethereal Shades are immune to damage from non-magical weapons.

By wrapping itself around a victim’s head, the ethereal shade may momentarily distract and befuddle its foe. The effects are similar to a Confusion spell and last as long as the ethereal shade remains wrapped around the victim’s head. Any damage inflicted upon the creature while it is wrapped around a foe will result in the ethereal shade taking half the damage, and its engulfed victim taking the other half. *(Author Skathros).*

- Ethereal Shade: **HD** 8; **AC** 1 \[18\]; **Atk** Icy touch (2d6) or befuddlement; **Move** 9; **Save** 8; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 10/1400; **Special**: Hard to see, immune to non-magic weapons.

### Ettercap

Ettercaps are a strange race of spindly, long-armed bipeds about seven feet tall. They have spider-like spinnerets, and are often found in the company of giant spiders. Ettercaps are flesh-eating predators who use their spinnerets to create traps of various kinds such as web-filled pits or deadfall traps with silken ropes.

- Ettercap: **HD** 5; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d3), 1 bite (1d8 + poison); **Move** 12; **Save** 12; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 6/400; **Special**: Poison bite, traps.

### Ettin

Ettins are two-headed giants, twelve to fifteen feet tall. They are difficult to catch by surprise, and make excellent guardians.

- Ettin: **HD** 10; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 2 clubs (3d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 5; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 10/1400; **Special**: None.

### Executioner's Hood

The executioner’s hood is a deadly monster, black in color and 1 inch thick, that resembles an actual executioner’s hood or a small black bag. It has two eyeholes that can be used to see into or out of the monster (if some unfortunate soul happens actually to pick it up — or worse, put it on). The executioner’s hood is sometimes used to guard valuable belongings. It does so unerringly as long as a constant supply of food is available. The executioner’s hood clings to the ceiling, waiting for prey to pass under it. When prey passes by, the hood drops and attempts to engulf the victim’s head. Slain victims are slowly devoured by the hood.

An executioner’s hood can try to wrap the head of a victim by making a normal melee attack against a surprised opponent. If successful, it establishes a hold and deals 1d4 points of damage each round it remains on the victim’s head. Opponents can tear it off by making a successful open doors roll as though their strength was 3 points lower. A creature whose head is engulfed cannot breathe, but can hold her breath for 2 rounds per point of constitution. After this period of time, the character must make a saving throw each round in order to continue holding her breath, with each successive roll made at a cumulative -1 penalty. When the character fails one of these saving throws, she suffocates and dies. Attacks that hit an engulfing executioner’s hood deal half their damage to the monster and half to the trapped victim. An creature whose head is engulfed cannot cast spells.

An executioner’s hood is vulnerable to wine, ale, brandy, or any other strong alcoholic drink. Each quart poured on the hood deals 1 point of damage to the creature. After the hood has taken 4 points of damage, it releases its hold on its opponent and drops to the ground. The next morning it suffers from a terrible headache unless properly hydrated.

- Executioner's Hood: **HD** 2; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** Choke (1d4); **Move** 6/3 (climbing); **Save** 16; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**: Engulf, immune to sleep, vulnerable to alcohol

### Exoskeleton, Giant (Ant)

Giant ant exoskeletons can be animated into undead creatures by unusual and rare necromantic magic. They are not poisonous. These dry husks are turned as skeletons. *(Author: Matt Finch)*

- Giant Ant Exoskeleton: **HD** 1; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** Bite (1d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 17; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 2/30; **Special**: Immune to sleep, hold, and charm spells, half damage from piercing and slashing weapons.

### Exoskeleton, Giant (Beetle)

Giant beetle exoskeletons are animated by necromantic magic quite different from that used in the Animate Dead spell. Bladed and piercing weapons cannot damage these dry, massive husks. They can be turned as ghasts, but are usually protected from turning by potent glyphs carved into their chitin exteriors. The insides of a giant beetle exoskeleton are quite hollow, and more than one necromancer has carpeted and cushioned the interior of a giant beetle exoskeleton for use as a slow-moving vehicle. *(Author: Matt Finch)*

- Giant Beetle Exoskeleton: **HD** 5; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 1 bite (2d6); **Move** 6; **Save** 12; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 7/600; **Special**: Immune to turning, unaffected by sleep, hold, and charm, immune to non-blunt weapons.

### Exoskeleton, Giant (Crab)

Giant crab exoskeletons are animated by specific necromantic spells, cast upon the very largest giant crab exoskeletons (10 ft. in diameter). Bladed and piercing weapons cannot damage these animated empty shells. They can be turned as mummies, but are usually protected from turning by potent glyphs carved into the shell, as are most giant exoskeletons. The insides are hollow, and up to four people can travel inside. *(Author: Matt Finch)*

- Giant Crab Exoskeleton: **HD** 6; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 2 pincers (2d6); **Move** 6; **Save** 11; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: Immune to turning, unaffected by sleep, hold, and charm, immune to non-blunt weapons.

### Exploding Bones

Nearly identical to skeletons in appearance, Exploding Bones differ in coloring from their more mundane counterparts. Exploding Bones are a bright pulsating red, their coloring becoming brighter and pulsating faster as they near death and the inevitable explosion which gives them their name.

When these crimson skeletons reach 0 hp their bodies explode sending a shower of jagged bones, which hit all within 20ft. All within this radius suffer 1d6 points of damage from the explosive shower of bony shrapnel. A successful Saving Throw halves this damage. Exploding bones are treated as Type 2 undead for turning purposes. *(Auhtor Skathros)*

- Exploding Bones: **HD** 2; **AC** 8 \[11\]; **Atk** 1 weapon (1d8); **Move** 12; **Save** 16; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**: Explode when killed.

### Eye Killer

Eye killers are subterranean dwellers that hate daylight. They dwell underground in dark places, where very little light can touch their sensitive eyes. They are evil, malicious creatures that delight in killing others, particularly those that wander to close to their lair. Eye killers are limbless spherical things at birth, but take a form that resembles a cross between a bat and a snake as they mature. The adult creature’s upper torso is that of a large bat while its lower torso is that of a snake. Dark green fur covers its upper body, while yellow-green scales cover its lower body. Its eyes are large, lidless, white circles without pupils. The average adult eye killer reaches a length of 7 feet. Its bat wings are useless. Eye killers seem to communicate with each other through a series of low rumbles and growls. They do not speak any known language.

The victim of an eye killer’s tail attack must pass a saving throw or be wrapped and constricted for 1d6 points of automatic damage each round until freed with a successful open doors check.

By using natural or magical light that illuminates it (i.e. it cannot be in the dark), an eye killer can amplify the light and refocus it in a line that functions as a death ray to a range of 50 feet. The eye killer must make a ranged attack against its target. If successful, the creature struck must make succeed on a saving throw or die instantly. Even if the save succeeds, the victim takes 3d6 points of damage. An eye killer can use this gaze once per day. Eye killers are immune to their own gaze attack and to the gaze attack of other eye killers. If the eye killer’s gaze attack is reflected back upon it, it amplifies the intensity and projects it at a new target as a free action. The saving throw against this amplified gaze attack is made at a -2 penalty.

If natural sunlight is brought within 5 feet of an eye killer, it immediately releases a constricted foe and attempts to move as far away from the source of light as possible. On subsequent rounds, an eye killer is dazzled as long as it remains within 5 feet of the light source.

**Umbral Eye Killer**

The umbral or shadow eye killer is a variant of the standard eye killer. It uses the statistics above for the standard eye killer but can see perfectly even in magic darkness and can cast *darkness 20’ radius* three times per day.

- Eye Killer: **HD** 6; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** Tail (1d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 11; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: Constrict, death gaze, light vulnerability

### Eye of the Deep

The eye of the deep is a 5-foot wide orb dominated by a central eye and large serrated mouth. Hundreds of small seaweed-like bristles hang from the bottom of its body. Two large crab-like pincers protrude from its body, and two long, thin eyestalks sprout from the top of its orb. Eyes of the deep are found only in the deepest parts of the ocean, though on occasion one moves too close to the shoreline and ends up beaching on the sands. An eye of the deep stranded in this manner dies in 2d4 minutes unless placed back into the water. Eyes of the deep speak their own language and the common tongue of seafaring humans. Creatures struck by the eye of the deep’s pincers must pass a saving throw or be caught and crushed for 2d4 points of automatic damage each round until they can pry open those pincers with an open doors check.

Each of the creature’s eyes stalks can produce a magical ray once per round. The creature can aim both of its eye rays in any direction. Each of its eye rays resembles a spell cast by a 12th-level caster and requires a ranged attack (ignores armor) to hit. Each eye ray has a range of 150 feet. The left eye emits a *hold person* ray, while the right eye emits a *hold monster* ray. By combining both eye rays, the eye of the deep can replicate the *phantasmal force* spell.

An eye of the deep’s central eye can, once per round, produce a cone extending straight ahead from its front to a range of 30 feet. Creatures in the area must succeed on a saving throw or be stunned for 2d4 rounds.

- Eye of the Deep: **HD** 10; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** Eye rays (see below), 2 pincers (2d4), bite (1d6); **Move** 3/9 (swimming); **Save** 5; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 13/2300; **Special**: Constrict, eye rays, stun cone

### Eyeless Filcher

An eyeless filcher is the undead body of a criminal maimed or tortured to death in brutal punishment for its crimes; usually these criminals were guilty of particularly heinous crimes during life. These creatures are animated by an extremely powerful undead force, which causes fear and horror in any onlooker: at the sight of an eyeless filcher, anyone failing a saving throw will either flee in terror for 1d12 rounds or be paralyzed until the undead is out of sight (equal chance). The eyeless filcher shares the same resistances and weaknesses of other powerful undead; it is immune to cold-based and mind-affecting spells, magical weapons are required to hit it, it can be turned by a cleric (as a wraith), and suffers harm from holy water (2d8). As there is precious little flesh left on its bones, the eyeless filcher suffers half damage from edged and pointed weapons. It may be distracted by the sight of symbols of law and justice, such as the insignia of the city watch or the holy symbol of a deity of law, and will break off attacking to focus its rage on this image. An eyeless filcher retains any criminal knowledge and thieving skills it had in life, and will use these to its advantage. In combat, if both of its claw attacks hit, it latches on with inhuman strength, strangling for automatic damage (2d6 total) per round thereafter; its deadly grip can only be broken by distracting symbols as above, the death of its victim, or a sincere apology from anyone involved in its own capture, trial, and punishment. If the eyeless filcher manages to kill an officer of the law, whether guard or magistrate or scribe of the court, the unfortunate victim rises from the dead the next day as a double-strength zombie under its control. The eyeless filcher attacks and steals, deliberately causing as much chaos and fear as it can. If a law officer renounces his profession in the creature’s presence it will sink to the ground, destroyed, with a mocking laugh. *(Auhtor Scott Wylie Roberts, "Myrystyr")*

- Eyeless Filcher: **HD** 9; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d8); **Move** 12; **Save** 6; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 12/1700; **Special**: Immune to non-magic weapons, strangle, half damage from non-blunt weapons.

### False Spider, Giant

False spiders are spiderlike creatures that are very aggressive and highly predatory in nature, often hunting at night when the element of surprise is theirs to be had. False spiders dwell in shallow burrows which the dig with their massive pincers. There are two kinds of false spiders: pedipalps and solifugids.

False spiders are highly territorial and are likely to attack any living creature that enters their area.

#### Pedipalp

Pedipalps are called whip scorpions and look like a cross between a spider and a scorpion. They have eight legs and two thin antennae. Its front sports two spider-like eyes and a set of large mandibles. Two large scorpion-like pincers protrude from just in front of its foremost legs. The average pedipalp is 5 feet long but can grow to a length of 10 feet.

- Pedipalp: **HD** 2; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d4), bite (1d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 16; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 2/30; **Special**: none

#### Pedipalp, Poisonous

The poisonous pedipalp is a rare variety of the species. Rarely encountered, the poisonous pedipalp is a solitary creature; no more than one has ever been encountered at a given time. They do not associate with others of their kind or with normal pedipalps. The poisonous pedipalp uses the same statistics as the normal pedipalp with save it has a challenge level of 3. When threatened, a poisonous pedipalp releases a cloud of noxious fumes in a 20-foot radius around its body. Living creatures within the cloud must succeed on a saving throw or be nauseated for 1d6 rounds. The poisonous pedipalp can use this cloud three times per day.

- Poisonous Pedipalp: **HD** 2; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d4), bite (1d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 16; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**: Noxious Cloud

#### Solifugid

Solifugids are at least 6 feet long but can grow to a length of 12 feet. They have eight legs, two spider-like eyes and a set of large, clicking, hooked mandibles. Two large scorpion-like pincers protrude from just in front of its foremost legs.

- Solifugid: **HD** 5; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d6), bite (1d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 12; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: none

### Falshantog-Yoth (Fal-yoth, the "Hungering Vines")

The Hungering Vines lives in darkness, with a ravenous hunger that can only be satiated by blood and flesh. This creature resembles a writhing mass of vines coming together at a trunk, supported by 4 huge roots. Many eye-stalks jut from the trunk, peering about for food; Fal-yoth is almost never surprised. The vines pull fresh carrion under its roots, where there is a huge mouth that consumes the plant’s victims. Fal-yoth can move surprisingly fast in a shambling gait, once it pulls its roots from the ground or rock into which it has settled. It takes 1 round for its vines to push it from the earth and allow it to move. Fal-yoth attacks any and all creatures that stray within reach of its vines (10ft) for 1d8 damage, or will twist its vines into a sort of “tail,” which can batter a single target for a colossal 4d10 points of damage. Any target hit by the “tail” will be knocked down and backward 1d4x10ft.

If a weapon successfully hits Fal-yoth, the creature’s corrosive sap spatters the weapon and destroys it. Magical weapons are permitted a saving throw. Fal-yoth can also generate a sphere of darkness within 30’ that lasts 1d4 rounds, every 10 minutes. Fal-yoth is partially immune to lightning attacks, taking half normal damage from such attacks. A saving throw is required each combat round to resist the horror of the hunger radiating from Fal-yoth. If a character fails his save, he is paralyzed by horror and unable to act that round. It may be that more than one of these creatures exist, but only one is known. *(Author: Chgowiz).*

- Falshantog-yoth - The Hungering Vines: **HD** 8, **AC** 9 \[10\], **Atk** all within 10 ft. (1d8) or 1 "tail" (4d10); **Move** 13 (0 when planted); **Save** 8, **AL** C; **CL/XP** 12/2000, **Special**: Destroys weapons successfully hitting it, generates darkness, partially immune to lightning, causes fear.

### Fear Guard

Fear guards appear as translucent hooded figures wearing flowing robes of gray or black over a suit of incorporeal armor. Their hands end in terrible claws. Their faces are a swirl of maddening images, fluctuating between a serene and calm countenance to a face twisted in horror and fear. Fear guards strike from the shadows, using their incorporeal touch. Any creature slain by the creature becomes a fear guard within 1d6 rounds. A fear guard radiates *fear* (as per the spell) in a 10-foot radius. Twice a day, a fear guard can cast *darkness, 15 ft. radius*.

- Fear Guard: **HD** 4; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** Incorporeal touch (1d6); **Move** 12 (flying); **Save** 13; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 6/400; **Special**: Fear aura, spell-like abilities, create spawn

### Felikaur

Felikaur were magically bred from tigers in ancient times, as a battle-beast of the feuding noble houses. Some escaped into the wild and flourished. The felikaur looks like a massive tiger, but with overlapping horn plates instead of fur. They have large bat-like wings sprouting from the shoulders, and a spiky tail. These creatures are intelligent enough to prepare ambushes and use their surroundings to tactical advantage; in the wild, they leap from cover to cover while attacking. In a gladiatorial arena, they are able to take advantage of pit traps, spikes, barriers, or other such tactical obstacles.

A felikaur’s tail spikes deal little damage, but secrete a paralysing toxin. They can also pick up a human or smaller foe, carry it into the air for a few rounds, and drop it from a height of 20 to 60 feet. Lastly, the felikaur can spit a glob of corrosive acid to a distance of 20 feet, for 1d6 to 3d6 damage (in any given day, the available stomach acid permits a total of 9 dice of potential damage). This acid will eat through and ruin clothing, non-magical armor, backpack straps, etc, in 1 round. The means by which the ancients controlled and tamed these beasts is unknown - they cannot be trained. *(Author: Scott Wylie Roberts, "Myrystyr")*

- Felikaur: **HD** 6; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d6), 1 bite (2d6), and tail (1d4+paralysis)); **Move** 15 (Fly 18); **Save** 11; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 10/1400; **Special**: Spit acid, drop opponents, surprise.

### Fen Witch

The fen witch is a creature of legend, found only in the most remote of places. It is a female humanoid with one nostril, webbed feet and hands, fiery red eyes and long, unkempt hair. It is a solitary creature and disdains all that invade its realm. The sight of a fen witch is so revolting that anyone who sets eyes upon one must succeed on a saving throw or instantly be weakened, taking 1d8 points of strength damage. This ability loss cannot reduce a victim’s Strength score to 0.

The fen witch can communicate telepathically with any creature within 100 feet that has a language. A fen witch can peer into the mind of a living creature within 60 feet in an attempt to extract the creature’s true name. The target can resist the mental trespassing by succeeding on a saving throw that requires all of their concentration. If the save fails, the fen witch has learned the creature’s true name and can use her death speak ability. Creatures with an intelligence score of 2 or less and non-sentient creatures are immune to this ability.

If the fen witch speaks the true name of an individual and the individual hears it, that creature must make a successful saving throw or die. If the save succeeds, that creature cannot be affected again by the same fen witch’s death speak for one day. Whether the fen witch’s death speak ability is successful or not, the target’s name remains fresh in her mind for one day. After that, she must use her mind probe ability again to retrieve a creature’s true name.

- Fen Witch: **HD** 6; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d4); **Move** 12; **Save** 11; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 11/1700; **Special**: Death speak, horrific appearance, mind probe, magic resistance (25%)

### Ferec (Foxtaur)

Orange-furred and bushy-tailed with large ears and multiple limbs, the Ferec is a mutated fox. It has a long body, with four pairs of legs, and a centaur-like humanoid torso with two pairs of arms. Despite its creative intelligence and expansive vocabulary, the ferec is excitable, superstitious, and easily distracted. It excels in various forms of craftsmanship, and enjoys puzzling out the workings of traps, puzzle boxes, unusual weapons, or other such contraptions. The heightened senses of a ferec, including superior night vision and heightened hearing, ensure it will never be surprised. They are sensitive to sunlight, and prefer a nocturnal lifestyle. *(Author: Scott Wylie Roberts, "Myrystyr")*

- Ferec: **HD** 6+3; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 2 weapons (1d6) and 1 bite (1d4); **Move** 18; **Save** 11; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 6/400XP; **Special**: Cannot be surprised.

### Fetch

A ragged-looking and rotting humanoid leaps from the snow, its filthy nails slashing through the frosty air. Its eyes are stark blue and its skin is pale white. Ice hangs from its scraggly hair. A fetch stands anywhere from 5 to 7 feet tall and weighs between 100 and 250 pounds. Its rotting flesh is drawn tight around its bones and flushed grayish-white. Its hair is scraggly and frozen and ice crystals cover its skin. A fetch’s eyes are stark blue. Fetches strike with their claws, which are supernaturally cold and deal 1d4 points of cold damage. A fetch is vulnerable to fire (taking an extra 50% damage).

- Fetch: **HD** 3+2; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d4); **Move** 6; **Save** 14; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**: Freezing touch, immune to cold, vulnerable to fire

### Fire Crab

A fire crab resembles a large crab in most respects. Its carapace is reddish-brown with dark red or yellow markings and its body is slightly square-shaped. Tiny flames lick its body, erupting at irregular intervals from its underbelly. Its eyes are perched on the end of two large eyestalks that protrude from the center of the carapace. Fire crabs have large claws and in males, one claw is always larger (at least three times larger) than the other. Fire crabs have six segmented and spindly legs, blackish-red in color. Fire crabs generate intense heat, dealing heat damage with their claw attacks.

- Fire Crab (1 HD): **HD** 1; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d3 + 1d4 fire); **Move** 6/9 (swim); **Save** 17; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 1/15; **Special**: Heat, immune to fire
- Fire Crab (4 HD): **HD** 4; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d6 + 1d6 fire); **Move** 9/12 (swim); **Save** 13; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: Heat, immune to fire

### Fire Nymph

Fire nymphs are beautiful females with long, flowing, fiery-red hair, pale blue eyes and skin with the color and scent of cinnamon. Fire nymphs dwell on the Elemental Plane of Fire. Fire nymphs rarely visit the Material Plane, though mages are known to request their company on occasion. A fire nymph usually wears translucent robes of white or ash. Fire nymphs can all spells involving fire as 7th-level spell casters. A fire nymph’s body generates intense heat, causing opponents to take an extra 1d4 points of damage every time the creature touches the fire nymph. A fire nymph’s metallic weapons also conduct this heat.

- Fire Nymph: **HD** 2; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** Dagger (1d4 plus 1d4 fire) or slam (1d2 plus 1d4 fire); **Move** 12; **Save** 16; **AL** C or N; **CL/XP** 6/400; **Special**: Heat, spells, immunity to fire, magic resistance (5%), double damage from cold

### Fire Phantom

Fire phantoms appear as humanoids with raging fire for hair, flame-encased fists, and elemental fire playing across their bodies. A fire phantom’s eyes are tiny balls of molten fire, as is its tongue. Fire phantoms attack with fiery fists that deal an extra 1d6 fire damage. Once every 1d4 rounds, they can hurl a globe of concentrated flame up to 30 feet (2d6 damage, save avoids). As a last resort, a fire phantom can detonate itself in an inferno that does 6d6 points of damage to all creatures within a 10-foot radius (save for half). The explosion kills the fire phantom if it fails a save, and causes its flames to extinguish for 1 round if it succeeds.

- Fire Phantom: **HD** 6; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 1 slam (1d4 + 1d6 fire); **Move** 6; **Save** 11; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 7/600; **Special**: Fire blast, immune to fire, immolation

### Fire Snake

A fire snake resembles a normal snake with reddish-orange scales and stark white eyes. They range in size from 2 feet to 6 feet in length. Fire snakes make their homes in fires and rarely journey more than 30 feet from such an open flame. A fire snake’s preferred method of attack is to hide in a nearby fire and then surprise its foes as they come nearby. A fire snake attacks by biting its opponents with its sharp fangs. A creature hit by a fire snake’s bite must succeed on a saving throw or be paralyzed for 1d6 rounds.

- Fire Snake: **HD** 2; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** Bite (1d4 plus paralysis); **Move** 9/12 (climbing); **Save** 16; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 4/60; **Special**: Paralysis, immune to fire, double damage from cold, surprise on a roll of 1-4 on 1d6

### Fire Whale (Burning Leviathan)

A fire whale is about 30 feet long, though specimens as long as 60 feet have been seen swimming the fiery seas. The fire whale’s body is crimson red mottled with yellow and orange spots, particularly along the back and shoulder area. The fire whale has a wide angular mouth. A fire whale attacks with its bite and tail slap. Surface creatures that threaten a fire whale are subjected to its scalding blast attack. The blast of superheated air from the whale’s blowhole to burn opponents (4d6 damage, save for half).

- Fire Whale: **HD** 12; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 1 bite (3d6), tail slap (1d8); **Move** 18 (Swim); **Save** 3; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 13/2300; **Special**: Scalding blast, immune to fire

### Firefiend

A firefiend is a rare creature from the Elemental Plane of Fire that takes the form of a three-sided column of fire, each side sporting a single arm, leg and face. In each arm the creature carries a flaming longsword. Upon first glance, a firefiend strongly resembles a fire elemental of the same size, but beyond that the resemblance ends. Its three faces constantly scowl and scream at opponents, cursing them in the flowery language of the efreet. If an opponent understands this language, he will comprehend only incoherent babbling and cursing. Once every other round, each of the firefiend’s faces can spit a fiery cinder to a range of 10 feet at one opponent. A target takes 1 point of fire damage and must succeed on a saving throw or catch on fire. Because of their three faces, firefiends are very difficult to surprise.

- Firefiend: **HD** 8; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 3 longswords (1d8 plus 1d6 fire); **Move** 12; **Save** 8; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 9/1100; **Special**: Spit, immunity to fire, double damage from cold

### Fish, Giant

Giant fish can range from something barely larger than a shark to something as large as a whale. In general, these creatures will be at least 11 feet long, and will have 1HD per 2 feet of length. Thus, if rolling randomly for a giant fish, roll 1d10+10 feet to determine the length, and the hit dice will be half that number. If the roll is a “10,” (i.e., the fish would be 20 feet long) then it is a REALLY giant fish: roll 1d20 for additional feet in length. Thus, the maximum size for a giant fish is 40 feet, and for some unknown reason giant fish never seem to be exactly 20 feet in length; a matter for philosophers to puzzle upon. The truly giant fish can most likely swallow people whole on a natural roll of 18-20. Use the rules for creating monsters to determine the saving throws and experience point values of the varying sizes of giant fish. Giant fish might be intelligent (5% chance), in which case they might have an alignment other than Neutrality.

- Ferec: **HD** varies; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d6 per 5 feet in length); **Move** varies (roll 1d4+1 x 10); **Save** varies; **AL** N (usually); **CL/XP** varies; **Special**: None (or swallow whole)

### Flail Snail

Flail snails are solitary omnivores found in the deepest recesses of caverns, caves, and dungeons. There they sustain themselves on a diet of fungus, mold, and rodents. Flail snails are massive snails, the size of warhorses. Their heads are masses of four thick tentacles, each tipped with a mace-like ball. The snail’s shell is striped in bright colors of red, blue, yellow and green, while its flesh is gray-blue. The shell of a dead flail snail can be sold on the open market for 3,000–5,000 gp. Abrupt exposure to bright light blinds flail snails for 1 round. Any time a spell targets a flail snail, there is a chance it produces a random effect rather than affecting the creature. Only spells that directly affect a flail snail are warped. Area spells are not affected by this ability. Roll 1d10 and consult the table below to determine random effects.

**1d10 Result**
**1-2** Spell misfires; caster disoriented for 1d4 rounds and must make a saving throw to cast any spell while disoriented.
**3-4** Spell misfires; creature nearest the flail snail is affected as if the spell had been cast on him.
**5-7** Spell functions normally
**8-9** Spell fails; nothing happens
**10** Spell rebounds on caster

- Flail Snail: **HD** 4; **AC** 1 \[18\]; **Atk** 4 slams (1d8); **Move** 12; **Save** 13; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 6/400; **Special**: Immunity to fire and poison, light blindness, warp magic

### Flea, Giant

Giant fleas are blood-sucking parasites that prey on warm-blooded animals. They have strong hind legs with powerful tendons that allow them to leap up to three times their Move rate. A giant flea is about a foot long, with an oval, flattened body. If a giant flea hits with a bite attack, it latches on to automatically drain the creature’s blood (1d4 points of damage) in the next round. After it drains 4 total hit points, it leaps away to digest its meal. There is a 5% chance that a giant flea carries a disease.

- Flea, Giant: **HD** 5 hp; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d2 + blood drain); **Move** 6; **Save** 18; **AL** N; **CL/XP** B/10; **Special**: Blood drain, disease, leap

### Flenser

Flensers are undead creatures with the same appearance as ghouls, but wearing cloaks made of rotting skins, mainly those of humans – although if the flenser has not encountered humans or their kin recently, it may have resorted to adorning itself with the skins of animals. Flensers are considerably more intelligent than ghouls, and may be found leading ghoul packs.

Flensers have a 50% chance to be leading a pack of 2d6 ghouls, with a 25% chance that there are also 1d2 ghasts in the group. Like ghouls, the claws and bite of a flenser can induce paralysis, but the flenser’s paralysis is extremely powerful – the saving throw against it is made at a penalty of -4 on the saving throw, and elves are not immune to the effects. If a flenser kills a foe, it skins the corpse before eating the flesh, and adds the skin to its hideous cloak. *(Author: Matt Finch)*

- Flenser: **HD** 8; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d6) and 1 bite (1d6+2); **Move** 12; **Save** 8; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 9/1100XP; **Special**: Paralysis.

### Flind

Flinds are a race closely related to gnolls. The two races share some strong similarities, and at first sight inexperienced adventurers could easily confuse the two. Flinds are much stockier than their lanky kin, much stronger and hardier, and are certainly more dangerous. It is unknown if flinds are a subspecies of the gnoll or a genetic anomaly produced among large gnoll packs. Flinds are often found among gnoll bands acting as leaders; their strength and relatively superior intelligence puts them above their lesser brethren. Flinds speak Gnoll and about 15% of them also speak the common tongue.

A flindbar is a weapon that consists of two iron bars, approximately 18 inches in length, connected by a length of chain. With a flindbar, the wielder gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls made to disarm an enemy. Flindbars inflict 1d6 points of damage. They weigh 2 pounds and cost 4 gp.

- Flind: **HD** 2 + 2; **AC** 1 \[18\]; **Atk** Flindbar (1d6+1); **Move** 12; **Save** 16; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 2/30; **Special**: none

### Floating Eye

Floating eyes look like 6-inch long, semi-transparent fish with a single large eye located in the center of its body along its dorsal region. They are most often found underground in forgotten dungeon waterways and underground lakes and seas. The creature’s eye is capable of bioluminescence, and it has such minute control over the intensity and patterns of the light that it can mesmerize other creatures that see it. Floating eyes are part of an unusual symbiotic relationship with a variety of predatory fish, including sharks. Once the floating eye has mesmerized its prey, predatory fish move in and consume it. After they have eaten, the floating eye moves in and gorges itself on the scraps. Floating eyes are small saltwater fish that have transparent bodies and a single large eye about the size of a walnut located in the center of their body. Creatures meeting the gaze of a floating eye must succeed on a saving throw or stare blankly at the floating eye for 1d6+1 rounds. A swimming creature that fails its save does not sink, but floats on the surface of the water.

- Floating Eye: **HD** 1d6; **AC** 3\[16\]; **Atk** Bite (1d2); **Move** 24 (Swim); **Save** 18; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 1/15; **Special**: Hypnotic gaze, surprise on a roll of 1-5 on 1d6

### Flowerchild

A flowerchild resembles a mass of flowers that can shape itself in any way it desires, from a carpet to a roughly humanoid form. It does not make any sort of physical attack, but anyone coming within 50ft of one of these plants has walked into considerable danger. The area around the flowerchild has a sweet smell that causes anyone breathing it to become utterly peaceful and uninterested in taking any action other than to sleep (a successful saving throw allows the victim to shake off this effect). The magically-induced lassitude is permanent unless the victim is brought out of the flowerchild’s scent. Once it has a helpless victim nearby, the flowerchild will release a cloud of pollen that causes a victim to make a saving throw every three rounds while exposed. If the saving throw fails, the victim becomes a planting-ground for the flowerchild seeds. The victim will begin transforming into a flowerchild, with the transformation becoming complete after 1d3+2 days. A *cure disease* spell will end the infection by killing the pollen.

Flowerchildren are immune to blunt weapons and piercing weapons. *(Author: Matt Finch)*

- Flowerchild: **HD** 5; **AC** 8 \[11\]; **Atk** None; **Move** 1; **Save** 12; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 7/600XP; **Special**: Peaceful feelings, pollen, immune to blunt and piercing weapons.

### Flowershroud

A flowershroud is a carpet-like floral growth, connected by a network of stems and tendrils underneath the blossoms. The tendrils allow the shroud to move slowly from place to place when it is seeking new food, for these are carnivorous plants that hunt down prey. When attacking, a flowershroud lashes out with a strand of thorned blossoms, inflicting 1d4 hit points of damage but also injecting an irritant poison that causes the victim to go into convulsions for 1d6+3 rounds, losing 1 hit point per round until the convulsions cease. Flowershrouds are immune to all but cutting weapons. *(Author: Matt Finch)*

- Flowershroud: **HD** 3; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 1 thorn-strand (1d4); **Move** 3; **Save** 14; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 4/120XP; **Special**: Convulsion poison, immnune to non-cutting weapons

### Flumph

This small (2 feet in diameter) strange creature looks like a saucer-shaped jellyfish with many small spike-like tentacles dangling from its underbelly. Its body is milky-white in color. Two short eyestalks protrude from the top of its body. Its eyestalks are gray as are its tentacles. Its eyes are jet black. Flumphs are strange beings that spend their days floating along looking for food and water. They are non-offensive and only attack when actively hunting for food. Flumphs prefer the darkness of the underground and are rarely, if ever, encountered above ground.

A flumph that hits an opponent with its spikes injects acid into the wound, dealing 1d4 points of damage. The acid damage continues for the next 2d4 rounds. Immersion in running water or a *cure light wounds* spell stops the acid damage. A flumph’s nauseating spray is a 20-foot line that it can fire twice per day. A creature hit by this poison must make a saving throw or be sickened for 5 rounds. The odor from this spray lingers in the area (and on any creature hit) for 1d4 hours and can be detected to a range of 100 feet. Creatures that come within 100 feet of an affected area or creature during this time must succeed on a saving throw themselves or become sickened for 5 rounds.

A flumph is helpless if turned over (requires a successful grapple attack).

- Flumph: **HD** 2; **AC** -1\[20\]; **Atk** Nauseating spray (sickened) or spikes (1d6 plus 1d4 acid); **Move** 9 (Fly); **Save** 16; **AL** L; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Acid, nauseating spray

### Fly, Giant

Giant flies are larger relatives of normal flies. Like their lesser cousins, they are most often found in areas of garbage, litter, and refuse. A giant fly resembles a normal fly and can grow to a length of 12 feet, though most average about 6 feet long.

- Giant Fly: **HD** 3; **AC** 5\[14\]; **Atk** Bite (1d6); **Move** 12/24 (Fly); **Save** 14; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: None

### Flying Jellyfish, Giant

As its name suggests, the Giant Flying Jellyfish is a marine life form that has adapted to existence in the skies. It is a hazard to sky-travelers and flying creatures, as it is almost translucent and is also known to hide in clouds. The giant flying jellyfish is partially gaseous in nature, and flies by means of jetting air. The giant flying jellyfish attacks by trailing its tentacles onto the decks of ships, into the space occupied by flying opponents, or through settlements when it hunts across the ground. It can make up to 2 attacks per 10ft cubic space occupied by opponents, to a maximum of 8 attacks. Each tentacle causes 2d6 damage, and may cause paralysis lasting 1d4 days (saving throw negates). It has also evolved a distinctive defence against magic. Any spell or similar attack against it builds up a charge in the creature, if it makes its saving throw. This charge is equal to 1 point per spell level, to a maximum equal to the jellyfish’s hit dice. In any round, in addition to making tentacle attacks, the giant flying jellyfish can discharge from 1 to 4 energy charges with the following effects: (1) All spell-casting beings within 50ft suffer intense mental distress for 1d3 rounds per charge, making it impossible to cast spells during this time. (2) All creatures and vessels flying via magic within 30ft have their movement rate halved for a period of 2 rounds per charge. (3) All creatures within 10ft of the giant flying jellyfish suffer -1 to all die rolls per charge expended for 1d2 turns. If severely threatened, the giant flying jellyfish may expend a blast of 8 charges, with effects as if 4 charges had been expended, but doubling the effective ranges of the blast’s effects. This massive expenditure of power also allows the jellyfish to quadruple its flying movement rate for 4 rounds in order to escape. Most specimens are 20-40 ft. in diameter, with 40-80ft long tentacles. Larger versions, of 24 or even 32 HD, may also exist, particularly in the ethereal realities or in the voids between the moons. *(Author: S**cott Wylie Roberts "Myrystyr")*

- Giant Flying Jellyfish: **HD** 16; **AC** 8 \[11\]; **Atk** up to 8 tentacles (2d6+paralysis); **Move** 0 (fly 9); **Save** 3; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 19/4100; **Special**: Discharge spell energy, paralysis.

### Flying Squirrel, Carnivorous

These squirrels, larger than normal flying squirrels, are carnivorous. They may attack humans if provoked, enchanted, or in sufficient numbers to feel confident of success.

- Carnivorous Giant Squirrel: **HD** 1d4hp; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d2); **Move** 6 (Glide 12); **Save** 18; **AL** N; **CL/XP** A/5; **Special**: Glide silently.

### Flytrap Shambler

Flytrap shamblers are mobile plants about the bulk of a horse, but they shuffle along the ground on thick, tentacle-like vines. The body is leafy and sometimes blooms with orchid-like flowers; the head rises on a fibrous stalk topped with the wide mouth of a venus flytrap, which can deliver a powerful bite. It is common for them to carry a polearm or spear in their front vines, for they can use such weapons in tandem with the bite. Despite their appearance, flytrap shamblers are relatively intelligent and often posted as guards by villains with the ability to control plants. Their value in this sort of role is somewhat compromised by the fact that they cannot talk.

Flytrap shamblers are capable of seeding themselves, but are almost always found as a result of direct cultivation by powerful villains who possess the knowledge and skill to breed such vegetation. The creation of a flytrap shambler involves magic, alchemy, and the skillful cultivation of several different flowering plants, some of which are not commonly found. There are manuals and librams describing the process, but these are for the most part forgotten lore.

The leafy body of a flytrap shambler is immune to damage from piercing weapons, but cutting and bludgeoning weapons inflict normal damage. *(Author: Matt Finch)*

- Flytrap Shambler: **HD** 3; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 1 bite (2d6); **Move** 6; **Save** 14; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: Immune to piercing weapons.

### Fogwarden

This creature resembles a humanoid formed of fog and mist. The only discernible facial feature is its icy blue eyes.  It is sometimes called an ice apparition, for much like the standard apparition, the fogwarden feeds on the fear of its victims. The fogwarden, however, is not undead. A fogwarden is usually found inhabiting the coldest and most desolate areas of the world. The fog surrounding it flashes with its life force. These flashes are often mistaken for the will-o’-wisp. The fogwarden’s natural is similar to the *gaseous form* spell, except that a fogwarden does not lose any abilities, can attack its foes, and has a fly speed of 15. A fogwarden radiates a 30-foot-radius fear aura. A creature in the area must succeed on a saving throw or be affected as though by a *fear* spell.

Electricity constantly plays across a fogwarden’s form. A creature holding a metal object that contacts the fogwarden takes 3d6 points of electricity damage (save for half damage). Once every other round, a fogwarden can loose this electricity as a stroke of lightning in a 30-foot line (save for half damage). This electrical aura of the fogwarden can animate dead creatures within 20 feet as the *animate dead* spell. The animated creatures resemble zombies (and use their stats) and are under the control of the fogwarden that animated them. They are not truly undead however and cannot be turned. If the fogwarden is slain or moves more than 20 feet from a zombie, the animated creature collapses dead and cannot be animated again.

Fogwardens shun sunlight. A fogwarden exposed to sunlight can take only move or attack each round, and is destroyed utterly after 1 hour of exposure if it cannot escape.

- Fogwarden: **HD** 4; **AC** 4\[15\]; **Atk** Lightning bolt (3d6); **Move** 15 (Fly); **Save** 13; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: Fear aura, lightning, animate dead, +1 or better weapon to hit, gaseous form, immunities (cold, electricity, poison), vulnerable to sunlight, surprise on 1-2 on 1d6

### Foo Dog

Foo dogs are extraplanar creatures that serve as guardians to those of the lawful alignment. They are rarely encountered on the Material Plane, but when they are, they are always in the employ of a lawful-aligned creature, acting as either a companion or guardian. A foo creature never associates with creatures of chaotic alignment. It tolerates those of neutral alignments.

This large dog has a slightly oversized head and large, bulbous eyes. Its paws end in sharp claws. Its fur is golden fading to crimson on the underside.

Foo dogs have a +2 bonus on to hit and damage rolls when fighting chaos-aligned creatures.

Once per day, by barking, a foo dog can summon 1d4 additional foo dogs with a 25% chance of success.

A foo dog is protected by an aura of goodness. A chaos-aligned creature that attacks a foo dog takes a –1 penalty on to hit and damage rolls.

A foo dog can become *invisible* and/or *ethereal* at will. A foo dog can enter the Astral Plane with up to six other creatures, provided they are all within 5 feet of the foo dog.

- Foo Dog: **HD** 7; **AC** 0\[19\]; **Atk** Bite (1d6); **Move** 15; **Save** 9; **AL** L; **CL/XP** 9/1100; **Special**: Strike chaotics, summon foo creatures, aura, etherealness, invisibility, plane shift, magic resistance (35%)

### Forester's Bane

The forester’s bane is a huge, immobile, and carnivorous shrub. Closer inspection reveals large, tough leaves radiating from its central stalk. These dark green leaves hide six purple serrated stalks inside its body. At the center of this low-growing shrub is a 3-foot diameter yellowish orb from which sprout many small green branches. Each branch has small, sweet smelling (and tasting) berries of various colors growing from it.

When a living creature moves near a forester’s bane’s leaves, it attempts to grab the creature. Trapped creatures are subjected to attacks by 1-6 serrated stalks that slash and cut until the opponent escapes. Trapped victims are attacked at a +2 bonus. The forester’s bane releases a trapped victim when either it or the victim is dead, or the leaf holding the victim is destroyed. Because of its four leaves, it can grapple up to four different opponents at one time. Both leaves and stalks each have 10 hit points and can be attacked. Severing a leaf or stalk deals no damage to a forester’s bane. Attacks that hit a leaf deal half their damage to the monster and half to the trapped victim. Destroyed leaves and stalks grow back in 2d4 weeks if the forester’s bane is not killed.

- Forester's Bane: **HD** 5; **AC** 2\[17\]; **Atk** 6 stalks (1d6); **Move** 0; **Save** 12; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 6/400; **Special**: Engulf

### Forgotten One

A forgotten one is a foot-tall fey with pointed ears, slanted eyes, and long, nimble limbs. Most forgotten ones weave twigs and leaves into their hair for decoration and to help conceal themselves in the treetops. Three time per day, a forgotten one can cause any creature within 20 feet to forget meeting the fey (save resists).

- Fogotten One: **HD** 3; **AC** 3\[16\]; **Atk** 1 weapon (1d3); **Move** 3; **Save** 14; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**: Forgetful presence

### Forlarren

The powers of a nymph are such that she can enchant and seduce nearly any creature that has the capacity to know beauty. Some say that even the great and terrible daemons are not immune to a nypmh’s charms. The forlarren, they say, is the proof. The forlarren is a lonely creature that feels cursed by its own existence. They look like hairless satyrs, a small ruff of dark hair covering the back of its head, small horns protruding above its eyes and a twisted, leering visage upon its face. They detest themselves and everything they see, consumed by hatred of life itself. Such is their rage that they seek to vent their ire on law and chaos alike. Forlarrens speak their own language and some actually speak the common tongue or the language of nymphs and dryads.

The forlarren attacks with its fists, using them to pummel an opponent. It focuses on a single opponent in combat and attacks until it or its opponent is slain. If a forlarren succeeds in killing an opponent, the kindly traits of its fey mother surface and it shows profound remorse. It ceases combat, if possible, or flees if other opponents insist on continuing the fight. Should its opponents allow combat to end, the forlarren may offer its solace to the surviving companions amid wails and sobs. After a few days, however, the dominant evil nature of its fiendish father resurfaces and the forlarren once more attacks all creatures on sight—including those it had previously befriended.

Once per day, by making a melee touch attack, a forlarren can heat metal (as the druid spell). Once the affected metal reaches the searing stage, it remains at that stage until the forlarren breaks contact with the affected metal. Once contact is broken, the metal slowly returns to its normal temperature (reducing the effects each round just as the *heat metal* spell).

- Forlarren: **HD** 3; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 2 strikes (1d4); **Move** 12; **Save** 14; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: Heat Metal

### Formian

Formians are highly intelligent ant-people, walking on their four hind legs but using their specialized fore-claws to hold objects. Their ant-like heads have deadly mandibles, which they use in combat. Formians have a caste society, like ants. The workers are small (about 75 pounds) and fairly stupid. Warriors are as large as a human being, and no more intelligent than the workers. A noble class, the taskmasters, rules formian society and are normally only found in the cities of this strange and alien race. These formians are as large as a horse, and extremely intelligent.

Formian cities are small, containing no more than 500 workers, 50 warriors, and 10 taskmasters, plus a royal retinue. The royal retinue includes a queen, males equal to half the number of taskmasters, and an additional 1d6 taskmasters, 3d6 warriors, and 6d6 workers. Formians also keep humans and members of other races as slaves or trade-goods.

- Formian Worker: **HD** 1; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d4); **Move** 15; **Save** 17; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 1/15; **Special**: None.
- Formian Warrior: **HD** 3; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d6), 2 mandibles (1d4), 1 sting (1 + non-lethal poison); **Move** 12; **Save** 14; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Non-lethal poison sting (2d4 damage, save for half).
- Formian Taskmaster: **HD** 7; **AC** 1 \[18\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d6+1), 1 sting (1d2 + non-lethal poison); **Move** 12; **Save** 9; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: Non-lethal poison (4d4 damage, save for half).
- Formian Male: **HD** 8; **AC** 1 \[18\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d6+1), 1 sting (1d2 + non-lethal poison); **Move** 12; **Save** 8; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 9/1100; **Special**: Non-lethal poison (4d4 damage, save for half).
- Formian Queen: Noncombatant, **HD** 10, **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** None; **Move** 6; **Save** 5; **AL** N; **CL/XP** noncombatant; **Special**: None.

### Fox Monk

The Fox Monk is a short fox-like humanoid, garbed in a shabby, quilted robe and bearing only a begging bowl and walking stick. Fox monks have taken vows of poverty and transience; they rely upon charity for food and somewhere to sleep, never staying in one area for more than a few days. They may defend themselves with a bite (1d4 damage), or in unarmed combat. A fox monk’s strike causes the target’s nervous system to spasm, causing him to drop any items held and move at half normal speed for 1d4 rounds (saving throw negates). Fox monks may also forego all attacks to perform dodging leaps, causing enemies to attack at -3 to hit. Lastly, a fox monk can cast Protection from Evil and Purify Food and Drink once per day. Despite their vows, these pious beggars are considered troublemakers by most civilized folk. *(Author: Scott Wylie Roberts, "Myrystyr")*

- Fox Monk: **HD** 2+3; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d4) or 1 strike (1d3 + spasms); **Move** 15; **Save** 16; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**: Spells, monkish strike.

### Frog

#### Frog, Giant

Giant frogs range in size from two or three feet long (a “small” giant frog), up to massive specimens of eight feet long (a “large” giant frog). In between are the “medium” giant frogs, five to six feet long. Large giant frogs can swallow opponents whole on a natural attack roll of 20. All giant frogs can make a 100ft leap that reaches a height of 20ft. Small giant frogs increase this length to 150ft. If an opponent is swallowed whole, he dies in three rounds. To escape, the victim cannot attack normally, and must have a bladed weapon to even attempt cutting his way out of the frog. An attack roll of 18 or better, including any modifiers, indicates that the victim cuts his way out of the frog, slaying the beast in the process. Attacks on the giant frog have a chance to damage a swallowed creature. Giant frogs can use their tongues to grab prey and haul them to the frog’s mouth; anyone grabbed in this way takes no damage until the frog begins to bite it in the following round, hitting automatically and inflicting maximum damage on that one attack. A group of giant frogs will generally be evenly mixed among the three sizes (roll 1d3 for hit dice on each frog in the encounter).

- Giant Frog (small): **HD** 1; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d3); **Move** 3 (or 150 ft. leap); **Save** 17; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 1/15; **Special**: Leap.
- Giant Frog (medium): **HD** 2; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d6); **Move** 3 (or 100 ft. leap); **Save** 16; **AL N; **CL/XP** 2/30; **Special**: Leap.**
- Giant Frog (large): **HD** 3; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d8); **Move** 3 (or 100 ft. leap); **Save** 14; **AL N; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: Leap, swallow whole.**

#### Frog, Giant Abyssal Dire

Abyssal dire frogs come from the Plane of Slime and are wholly chaotic. They have a demonic aspect to them, with a spiny and usually poisonous hide of blackish-green. Their red eyes flicker with demonic intelligence. They speak the language of demons. Abyssal dire frogs are about 12 feet long. Once per day, an abyssal dire frog can make a normal attack against a lawful foe to deal additional damage equal to the frog’s total Hit Dice.

An Abyssal Dire Frog’s tongue can be attacked. Damage dealt to the tongue is not dealt to the frog itself. If successful, the frog does not attempt a tongue attack against that opponent for the remaindof the combat. An Abyssal Dire frog’s tongue has an AC of 4\[15\]

- Giant Abyssal Dire Frog: **HD** 6; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** Tongue (grapple), bite (2d6); **Move** 12/15 (Swim); **Save** 11; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 9/1100; **Special**: Leap, smite law, swallow whole, +1 or better weapon to hit, magic resistance (10%) resistance to cold and fire (50%)

#### Frog, Giant, Killer

About three feet long, giant killer frogs are the product of mad breeding experiments. They have claws and teeth, and attack relentlessly.

- Giant Killer Frog: **HD** 1+4; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d2), 1 bite (1d4+1); **Move** 3 (leap 15); **Save** 17; **AL N; **CL/XP** 2/30; **Special**: Leap.**

### Froghemoth

This gigantic creature resembles a giant frog with 4 large tentacles in place of its front legs. A single eyestalk juts from the top of its head. Its underbelly is yellow, its body is green, and its tentacles and legs are mottled green. The froghemoth is a weird aberration that swells in marshes and swamps. Its tongue is 10 feet long and it uses it to capture its prey. The froghemoth is a carnivore and feeds on various swamp-dwellers.

The victim of a froghemoth’s tentacle attacks must pass a saving throw or be held fast and pulled to the mouth for a bite attack. Victims of a bite attack must likewise pass a saving throw or be swallowed whole. Once inside the beast’s belly, a creature suffers 3d8 points of damage per round. A swallowed creature can attempt climb to climb into the beast’s mouth, where it must make a successful open doors roll to escape. A swallowed creature can also cut its way out using a dagger to deal 20 points of damage to the froghemoth’s stomach (AC 6 \[13\]). A froghemoth’s stomach can hold 1 human or elf or 2 dwarves or halflings.

The froghemoth takes no damage from electricity, but is instead *slowed* for one round (per the reverse of the *haste* spell).

- Froghemoth: **HD** 16; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 4 tentacles (1d6), tongue (1d6), bite (4d6); **Move** 9/12 (Swim); **Save** 3; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 18/3800; **Special**: Swallow, resistance to fire (50%), slowed by electricity, surprise on roll of 1-2 on 1d6

### Froglum

In ages past, some mad experimenter created a golem from frog-flesh: the ancestor of all froglums. Some frog genes, however, can switch genders and even produce hermaphrodites. The ancestor of froglums was likely the first (and probably the only) self-breeding golem. Froglums are huge bipeds virtually identical to their shared ancestor: eight feet tall with slimy green skin, webbed feet, and great frog-like eyes. Their legs resemble those of frogs, but are much shorter and allow the froglum to stand upright. These creatures are soulless, having been bred from an unnatural and artificial origin. They have no detectable thoughts. In general, they serve any chaotic master, especially one who resembles a frog or a powerful wizard. They are seldom found acting on their own volition, for it is in their nature to follow a powerful master. A froglum’s slimy skin makes it resistant to fire (half damage). *(Author: Matt Finch)*

- Froglum: **HD** 8; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 2 fists (2d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 8; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: half damage from any fire.

### Frost Man

Frost men are hunters that make their home in the cold regions of the world. They appear to be brutish humans dressed in animal skins and furs and wearing a patch over one eye. Each carries his personal belongings in small sacks and takes them wherever he goes. A frost man’s body radiates cold out to 30 feet, though not enough to deal damage. Frost men are only ever encountered as lone males. Perhaps there are villages somewhere with women and children, perhaps frost men are spawned from the freezing waste itself. Tribes that are aware of frost men fear them greatly for their deadly talent and refer to them as “ice demons. Frost men speak their own language and the common tongue. Three times per day, a frost man can release a blast of freezing mist in a 30-foot cone from the eye underneath its eye patch. A creature in the area takes 3d6 points of cold damage (saving throw for half).

- Frost Man: **HD** 4; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** Weapon (1d8); **Move** 12; **Save** 13; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 6/400; **Special**: Ice blast, immunity to cold, double damage from fire

### Fulgurate Mushrooms

Fulgurate mushrooms appear as normal mushrooms with faint blue stems and either bluish-white caps or sapphire blue caps. A typical patch covers a 10-foot area. When touched, the mushrooms send out a burst of lightning that deals 2d6 points of damage (save for half) to any creature within 10 feet of the patch. Fulgurate mushrooms are instantly destroyed when they release their lightning blast.

- Fulgurate Mushrooms: **HD** 1; **AC** 9 \[10\]; **Atk** lightning blast (2d6); **Move** 0; **Save** 17; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 2/30; **Special**: lightning blast

### Fungal Creeper

The Fungal Creeper is a patch of fungus growing upon a boulder or wall, which often appears weathered and strangely corroded. The name comes from its ability to creep along the wall, moving about to follow living creatures. Fungal creepers draw sustenance from minerals found in rock and stone, but supplement their diets with fresh blood. The fungal creeper can sense the warmth of life within 60ft, and reacts by moving closer. It attacks by sinking tiny root-like appendages into exposed flesh, latching on to cause continuous damage if the attack roll is a 19 or 20. It may be distracted by fresh meat, whether in the form of rations no more than 1 day old or the body of an unconscious combatant. They are scavengers, and will move to feed off carrion as soon as it is detected. *(Author: Scott Wylie Roberts, "Myrystyr")*

- Fungal Creeper: **HD** 3; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 1 touch (1d6); **Move** 3; **Save** 14; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: Attaches on 19 or 20.

### Fungi, Violet

Violet fungi are large mushrooms with tentacle-like growths at the base. The tentacles are not long, averaging about 2-3ft. A hit from a tentacle causes flesh to rot (saving throw applies) unless a cure disease spell is cast upon the afflicted area.

- Violet Fungus: **HD** 3; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 4 tendrils (rot); **Move** 1; **Save** 14; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: Tendrils cause rot.

### Fungoid

A fungoid resembles a 6-foot-tall, stocky and powerful humanoid formed of mushroom flesh. Coloration varies from brownish-green or brown to dark green mottled with brown splotches. It weighs about 300 pounds. A fungoid’s facial features are discernible, but rough. Its arms end in powerful hands. Fungoids rush into combat swinging their powerful fists. They take half damage from electricity and are immune to charms.

- Fungoid: **HD** 5; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 2 slams (1d8); **Move** 6; **Save** 12; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Resists electricity, immune to charm

### Furious Fountain

A furious fountain resembles a large anthropomorphic stone fountain, usually spraying a jet of water from its mouth. These creatures are similar to golems, but the animating spirit within is an imprisoned water elemental.

When standing still, a furious fountain is indistinguishable from any ordinary fountain. A furious fountain may attack with its stony fist, or with a jet of water. The animate fountain can spew out a violent stream of water at a range of 200ft, three times per day. The target suffers 3d10 points of damage, and is pushed back the full remaining distance of the jet’s range (a successful save halves both the damage and the distance pushed back). A second saving throw allows the victim to remain standing and avoid dropping any items held in hand. Like golems, furious fountains are unaffected by non-magical weapons. These magical creatures can only be affected by spells that specifically target water or stone, with appropriate results to be determined by the referee. As a guideline, the fountain will lose, at most, 4d10 hit points from such spells; Part Water would be an example of a spell that might inflict such damage. *(Author: Skathros)*

- Furious Fountain: **HD** 15 (60hp); **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 1 fist (3d8) or water jet; **Move** 6; **Save** 3; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 18/3800; **Special**: Immune to non-magical weapons, immune to most magic, water jet.

### Fye

A fye resembles a translucent humanoid whose face is contorted and twisted as if frozen in an eternal scream. The fye is about 6 feet tall, and its lower torso tapers off around the knees into vaporous nothingness. Its face always has the appearance that the creature is screaming or howling though it never utters any sound. A fye continually emanates an aura of despair in a 10-foot radius that causes creatures to suffer a -2 penalty on attacks and saves (save resists). Once per round, a fye can attempt to possess an opponent with a successful touch attack (as per the *magic jar* spell, except it doesn’t require a receptacle). At will, a fye can cast *ESP*; three times per day it can cast *cause fear*; and once per day it can cast *feeblemind*.

- Fye: **HD** 5; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** Incorporeal touch (1d6 + possession); **Move** 24 (Fly); **Save** 12; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 7/600; **Special**: Aura of despair, possession, magical abilities

### Fyr

A fyr is a 3-foot tall, goat-headed humanoid with large slightly-backward-curved horns, goat-like legs, a small bushy tail, and a human torso. Its entire body, except its arms and hands, is covered in thick brown fur. Fyrs often adorn their body with rings, necklaces, bracelets, earrings, and other such trinkets. A fyr attacks by butting with its horns, but some use weapons. A fyr can use various spell-like abilities: at will—*speak with animals*; 4/day—*charm monster*; 3/day—*warp wood*; 1/day—*plant doorway.*

- Fyr: **HD** 2; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** head butt (1d4+1) or 1 weapon (1d6+1); **Move** 6; **Save** 16; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**: Spell-like abilities

## G

### Gallows Tree

A gallows tree is a 20-foot-tall tree with 6 or more humanoids hanging from its branches, each tightly secured by their necks with greenish-brown ropes. The gallows tree’s canopy is thick and bushy, and its trunk is formed of leathery bark, mottled brown. Gallows trees sustain themselves on the internal organs and body fluids of living creatures. Gallows trees lower zombies to the ground when prey comes within 100 feet of the tree. Foes that get within 15 feet are struck by the tree’s sharp branches. If two or more branches hit the same opponent, he is held and takes 2d6 points of damage automatically each round as the tree pummels him. The tree slices open victims for their organs, then fills them with a greenish sap that turns them into gallows tree zombies. The newly created undead rises in 1d4 days. A typical gallows tree has 6-11 gallows tree zombies hanging from it at any given time.

- Gallows Tree: **HD** 12; **AC** 0 \[19\]; **Atk** 6 slams (2d6); **Move** 6; **Save** 3; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 15/2900; **Special**: Create gallows tree zombies, grab, +1 magic weapons to hit, resists fire

### Gallows Tree Zombie

Gallows tree zombies are humanoid creatures with deathly gray-green skin that feels coarse and rough to the touch. Their clothes are tattered and torn, and some still wear the armor they wore in life (though it is now rusted, dented, or damaged). Many have small plants, weeds, or fungi growing on or from their bodies. A long, sinewy cord of greenish-brown wraps around the zombie’s throat and connects it to a gallows tree. Gallows tree zombies hang motionless from the tree that created them, being lowered to the ground only when a living creature comes within 100 feet of the gallows tree they are connected to. Once every 1d4 rounds but no more than 3 times per day, a gallows tree zombie can breathe a cloud of poisonous spores. Anyone caught in the spore cloud must make a save or be slowed (as per the *slow* spell). Gallows trees zombies regenerate 2 hit points per round as long as they remain connected to their tree by their tether-vine. The vine allows the zombie to move up to 100 feet away from the tree.

- Gallows Tree Zombie: **HD** 4; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 2 slams (1d6); **Move** 9; **Save** 13; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Spore cloud, tether-vine, regenerate 2 hp/round

### Gambado

A gambado makes its lair in a 6-foot deep pit. It hides its body with rocks, leaves and anything else in the surrounding area, allowing only its head to be seen. Beneath the leaves, the gambado is a human-sized creature with a cylindrical torso. Two long arms ending in razor-sharp claws protrude from the body. Its torso ends in three long, single-toed feet. Its body is gray in color and leathery and can be compressed like a spring. This is its primary means of locomotion. By compressing its body, the gambado can spring up or forward.

Gambado are solitary creatures by nature, and on the rare occasion that more than one is encountered, each will have its own lair and pit from which it attacks. The pits are usually close together to maximize their attacks on creatures within the area. Any treasure collected by a gambado is stored on its pit floor or in a small and well-hidden hole in the side of its pit. It is unknown whether gambados can communicate or speak any languages.

- Gambado: **HD** 4; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** Bite (1d8), 2 claws (1d4); **Move** 15; **Save** 13; **AL** N (C Tendencies); **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: Surprise on roll of 1-3 on 1d6

### Gargoyle

Gargoyles are winged beings resembling the carven monstrosities that bedeck the walls of cathedrals and many subterranean dungeons. They are terribly vicious predators.

- Gargoyle: **HD** 4; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d3), 1 bite (1d4), 1 horn (1d6); **Move** 9 (Fly 15); **Save** 13; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 6/400; **Special**: Fly, magic weapon required to hit.

### Gargoyle, Four-Armed

Four-armed gargoyles have a great fondness for inflicting pain on their foes. When a four-armed gargoyle has the upper hand in battle, it often draws out the conflict as long as it can in order to deal as much pain and suffering as it can on its foes.

- Four-Armed Gargoyle: **HD** 4+1; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 4 claws (1d4), bite (1d6), gore 1d6); **Move** 15/24 (Flying); **Save** 13; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 6/400; **Special**: +1 or better weapon to hit, freeze

### Gargoyle, Fungus

A fungus gargoyle stands about 6 feet tall and weighs up to 200 pounds and looks like it is carved from molds, fungi and mushrooms. Every 1d4 rounds, a fungus gargoyles can breathe a 30-foot cone of fungus particles that causes 1d6 points of damage to any opponent who inhales the substance (a successful saving throw keeps the fungi particles from taking root in the windpipe). A fungus gargoyle also exudes a horrible stench in a 10-foot-wide cloud around it that causes those who get too near it to spend the next round retching if they fail a saving throw.

- Fungus Gargoyle: **HD** 5; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d6); **Move** 15/24 (Flying); **Save** 12; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**: fungus breath, stench

### Gargoyle, Green Guardian

Green guardian gargoyles are carved of a strange green stone and have two eyes of jet (500 gp each). The eyes radiate magic and evil if detected. If a green guardian gargoyle hits an opponent with both claw attacks, that opponent must succeed on a saving throw or be *held* for 4 rounds as if by a *hold person* spell. Unlike the *hold person* spell, a held creature does not receive a new save each round to break the effects. A green guardian gargoyle that has been killed reanimates in 1d8+2 days at full strength unless its eye gems are crushed and disenchanted with both *dispel magic* and *remove curse*.

- Green Guardian Gargoyle: **HD** 4+1; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d4), bite (1d6), gore (1d6); **Move** 15/24 (Flying); **Save** 13; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: +1 or better weapon to hit, freeze, hold, reanimation

### Gargoyle, Maggog

Maggogs are bat-winged gargoyles. They can utilize magic as a 5th level magic-user (4/2/1). Typically they are found deep in the bowels of the earth. Maggogs are related to demons, but aren’t guardians of the underworld. Their terrible claws can inflict damage, along with a barbed tail, which is used as a stinger. *(Author: Old Crawler)*

- Maggog: **HD** 5+1; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d6) and 1 sting (1d8); **Move** 12 (Fly 18); **Save** 12; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 7/600; **Special**: Spell use.

### Gargoyle, Margoyle

A margoyle is a slightly larger version of the standard gargoyle. It is meaner, more wicked, and deadlier than its smaller kin. Margoyles are most often encountered in subterranean regions and often have a pack of gargoyles with them. In such cases, the margoyle is looked upon as the master or leader of the group.

- Margoyle: **HD** 6+1; **AC** 1 \[18\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d6), bite (1d6), gore (1d6); **Move** 15/24 (Flying); **Save** 11; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: +1 or better weapon to hit, freeze

### Gas Spore (1)

From a distance greater than 10 feet, the gas spore is likely to be mistaken for a beholder (1 in 6 chance to notice the difference). T The gas spore has a fly speed of 10 feet with average maneuverability.

When a gas spore contacts a living creature (or a living creature touches a gas spore unarmed or with natural attacks), it injects poisonous rhizomes into the foe if that opponent fails a saving throw. Each day thereafter, an infected creature must succeed on a saving throw (-1 cumulative penalty per day) or take 1d6 points of damage. Damage continues until the victim dies or the rhizomes are destroyed. At 0 hit points, a victim dies and 2d4 gas spores emerge from its body. A *cure disease* spell cast on an affected creature before it dies destroys the rhizomes and prevents any further damage.

If a gas spore is struck for a single point of damage (by a weapon, natural attack, spell, or effect), it explodes in a violent blast of gas that deals 6d6 points of damage to all creatures within a 30-foot radius. A successful saving throw reduces the damage by half.

### Gas Spore (2)

The gas spore is a spherical, chitin-armored sac containing fungus spores, about five feet in diameter, with some moving tendrils growing from the top of the sphere. The sac contains lighter-than-air gases which allow it to float in the air, and it can move by expelling some of these gases in a form of jet-propulsion. When it is near any warm-blooded creatures, it will move toward them by instinct: these creatures are completely non-intelligent.

If a gas spore gets close enough to touch a living creature, it will inject spores into the target with a successful to-hit roll. If the victim fails a saving throw, these spores will bloat and transform the host into 1d6+1 new gas spores within 24 hours unless a *cure disease* spell is used to prevent this (rather disgusting) transformation.

Moreover, when a gas spore is killed (and it is designed by nature to burst easily), it explodes in a radius of 20ft, inflicting 6d6 points of damage in that area (half damage with a successful saving throw). The body of anyone killed by the blast will also begin transforming into new gas spores.

- Gas Spore: **HD** 1d4 hp; **AC** 9 \[10\]; **Atk** 1 touch (disease); **Move** 0 (Fly 3); **Save** 18; **AL N**; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: Causes disease, explodes, attacks as 3HD monster.

### Gelatinous Cube

Gelatinous cubes are semi-transparent cubes that slosh through subterranean passages, engulfing debris and carrion to digest. Their entire substance is acidic; if the cube hits successfully, the victim must make a saving throw or become paralyzed (6 turns) for the cube to devour. Most gelatinous cubes contain various metallic treasures or gems that they have engulfed but not yet digested.

- Gelatinous Cube: **HD** 4; **AC** 8 \[11\]; **Atk** 1 (2d4); **Move** 6; **Save** 13; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Paralysis, immune to lightning and cold.

### Gelid Beetle, Greater

Greater gelid beetles are larger, meaner versions of the standard gelid beetle. They are almost always hungry and are usually encountered while hunting. Gelid beetles bite opponents, delivering cold damage with each hit. Once per minute, a gelid beetle can emit a cloud of ice cold vapors in a 20-foot radius around its body that deals 2d6 cold damage (save for half) to creatures caught within it. The cloud lasts for 1d4+3 rounds.

- Greater Gelid Beetle: **HD** 12; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d6 + 1d8 cold); **Move** 12; **Save** 3; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 13/2300; **Special**: Cold, cold cloud, immune to cold

### Gelid Beetle, Lesser

Gelid beetles appear as stark white beetles with silvery-black legs and dull silver mandibles. Some specimens have a mottled silver or black carapace and an even rarer species has dull crimson wing covers. Gelid beetles have two sets of eyes equally spaced on their heads dull silvery-black in color. Gelid beetles bite opponents, delivering cold damage with each hit. Once per day, a gelid beetle can release a spray in a 10-foot cone that deals 2d4 cold damage (save for half).

- Lesser Gelid Beetle: **HD** 4; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d4 + 1d4 cold); **Move** 15; **Save** 13; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Cold, cold spray, immune to cold

### Genie

#### Genie, Abasheen

An abasheen stands about 8 feet tall and is always dressed in flowing robes colored to denote their current station. Their skin is dark and their build powerful. All have dark hair, either black or brown, and most wear their hair braided or pulled into a ponytail, tied with ribbons of gold or silver. They are akin to genie nobility and act the part. Abasheens slam opponents with their powerful fists and employ their spell-like abilities in combat: at will—*charm person*; 1/day—*quest*. An abasheen can turn itself into a whirlwind much like an air elemental, sweeping away creatures with one or fewer hit dice (the diameter of the whirlwind is 20 ft.)

- Abasheen: **HD** 8; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 2 slams (1d10+1); **Move** 9/24 (Flying); **Save** 8; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 10/1400; **Special**: Spell-like abilities, whirlwind

**Genie, Abasheen** from the [Tome of Horrors Complete](http://shop.d20pfsrd.com/products/sw-the-tome-of-horrors-complete), Copyright 2011, Necromancer Games, Inc., published and distributed by Frog God Games; Authors Lance and Travis Hawvermale.

#### Genie, Hawanar

Hawanar are 12-feet-tall genies whose lower torsos are shrouded in a cyclone of flame. A hawanar can create food and water as well as wooden and cloth objects. They can create metal objects (including coins), but all such magically created metals disappear in time. Hawanar can become *invisible* at will and can create realistic illusions that disappear when touched. Finally, a hawanar can turn into a flaming whirlwind that sweeps away creatures with one or fewer hit dice and deals 1d6 points of fire damage. (The diameter of the whirlwind is 10 feet.) Some hawanars can grant true wishes. A hawanar’s attacks cause flammable materials to burst into flame.

- Hawanar: **HD** 11; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 2 fists (1d8 + fire); **Move** 10/16 (Flying); **Save** 3; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 15/2900; **Special**: Magical abilities, immune to fire, fiery cyclone

#### Genie, Marid

A marid is a blue genie standing about 16 feet tall and weighing nearly 2,500 pounds. These powerful beings can transform into a maelstrom in water to carry creatures and objects away. This watery cyclone overturns small boats and sinks larger vessels in 1d4+4 rounds. Marids also can rise out of the ocean to attack ships, and will batter vessels to pieces within 1 hour if not prevented or distracted. A marid can turn invisible, *polymorph self*, *create water* and *control water* at will. Some marids can grant limited wishes.

- Marid: **HD** 11; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 2 fists (1d8); **Move** 10/16 (Swimming); **Save** 3; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 13/2300; **Special**: Magical abilities, whirlpool

### Geon

A geon appears as a large, boulder-like creature, though similar in a way to xorn. They have two large legs and feet, which also act as hands, allowing the geon to manipulate items with them. Two large recesses on its surface function as eyes. A geon has a large, wide mouth. Geons animate boulders to attack its foes and create walls of stone to contain them. The geon can animate any rocks within 180 feet at will, and can control up to two rocks at a time. Boulders (Move 6) fight as geons in all respects. Geons can: 1/day--*move earth, passwall, transmute rock to mud, wall of stone*. Geons are vulnerable to cold and take one-and-a-half damage. They take half damage (or none if they save) from fire and electricity.

- Geon: **HD** 8; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 2 slams (2d8+2); **Move** 6; **Save** 8; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 9/1100; **Special**: Animate boulders, spell-like abilities, vulnerable to cold, immune to fire and electricity

### Ghast

Ghasts are highly intelligent ghouls. Their charnel stench is so powerful that anyone nearby (about 10ft) must make a saving throw or suffer a –2 penalty on attack rolls. As with ghouls, a hit from a ghast causes paralysis if the victim fails a saving throw.

- Ghast: **HD** 4; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d3), 1 bite (1d6); **Move** 15; **Save** 13; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Stench, paralyzing touch.

### Ghost

There are innumerable types of ghosts with varying qualities, often depending on the nature and circumstances under which the person died. One example follows.

#### Ghost, Strangling

These apparitions are similar to banshees, but instead of screeching they can attack only a single opponent at a time, strangling the victim with insubstantial hands. If the attack hits, the victim must make a saving throw or die within 1d4+1 rounds. A *remove curse* spell will break the creature’s hold during this time period. *Protection from evil* spells will hold these creatures at bay. Anyone strangled by a strangling ghost will rise as a strangling ghost within 1d6 days. *(Author: Matt Finch)*

- Strangling Ghost: **HD** 5; **AC** 0 \[19\]; **Atk** 1 strangulation (save or die in 14+1 rounds); **Move** (Fly 12); **Save** 12; **AL** usually C; **CL/XP** 7/600; **Special**: Magic Resistance (50%), magic or silver weapon required to hit, strangles (if hit, save or die in 1d4+1 rounds).

### Ghoul

Ghouls are pack-hunting undead corpse eaters. They are immune, like most undead, to charms and sleep spells. The most dangerous feature of these horrid, cunning creatures is their paralyzing touch: any hit from a ghoul requires a saving throw or the victim becomes paralyzed for 3d6 turns.

- Ghoul: **HD** 2; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d3), 1 bite (1d4); **Move** 9; **Save** 16; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**: Immunities, paralyzing touch.

### Ghoul, Ao-Nyobo (Blue Wife)

This female ghoul-creature can be found lurking in the ruins of old castles. They resemble old, courtly ladies with blue skin, blackened teeth, and no eyebrows. As with ghouls and ghasts, a hit from the Ao-nyobo causes paralysis if the victim fails a saving throw. The Ao-nyobo is capable of flight and prefers to ambush victims from above - often hiding in the rafters of half-ruined buildings to swoop down upon the unsuspecting. In the outdoors, an Ao-nyobo will often chase down any escaped prey in a relentless, airborne hunt. Ao-nyobo are turned as ghasts. *(Author: Mike Davison)*

- Ao-nyobo: **HD** 4; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d4), 1 bite (1d6); **Move** 14 (fly 9); **Save** 13; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 6/400; **Special**: Paralyzing touch.

### Ghoul, Cinder

A cinder ghoul is ghost-like spirit in the form of a swirling humanoid cloud of burning ash and charred body parts. Its dark, smoky shape is lit here and there with the red glow of perpetually burning embers, and the grisly remains of scorched body parts can occasionally be glimpsed floating within the mass. These baleful undead creatures reek of smoke and burnt flesh. A cinder ghoul’s touch drains 1 level. Any creature struck by the ghoul’s vicious touch also suffers 1d6 fire damage and must save or catch on fire.

- Cinder Ghoul: **HD** 6; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 1 slam (1d8 + 1d6 fire + level rain); **Move** 12 (flying); **Save** 11; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: Drains 1 level with hit, fire

### Ghoul, Crimson

Crimson ghouls are created by strange and terrible magical procedures worked by necromancers upon a normal ghoul. They are not ordinarily found in the wild, as regular ghouls are, although from time to time a pack of crimson ghouls might outlive or escape from their masters. In this case, the crimson ghouls will be found in the same sorts of desolate or cursed spots as normal ghouls, even competing with them for the horrid, charnel foods they crave. As with normal ghouls, the touch of a crimson ghoul causes paralysis for 3d6 turns unless the victim makes a saving throw.

As one might expect from the name, crimson ghouls have hides the color of blood. They otherwise resemble normal ghouls, although they are stronger and have a more powerful bite. In addition to the skin color and a more robust physical frame than their ghoulish brethren, crimson ghouls have another signal distinction from a normal ghoul, which is that normal weapons only inflict half damage against them. Magical weapons inflict full damage. Moreover, crimson ghouls are somewhat resistant to spells: they gain a +1 bonus on saving throws against any spell. As with most undead, they are immune to sleep spells, but they can be affected by a charm person or a charm monster spell (although the duration of the charm is extremely short, not lasting more than 1d6 rounds). This strange vulnerability seems to be the result of the necromantic procedures by which they are prepared, a by-product of being created as loyal servants to their necromantic masters. *(Author: Matt Finch)*

- Crimson Ghoul: **HD** 4; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d3), 1 bite (1d6); **Move** 9; **Save** 13; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 6/400; **Special**: Half damage from non-magic weapons, +1 save vs. spells, paralysis.

### Ghoul, Dust

Dust ghouls are dust-covered creatures with decaying flesh pulled tightly over their humanoid frames. Their teeth are pointed fangs and their hands end in wicked, dirt-covered and blood-soaked claws. Once per round, a dust ghoul can emit a hellish shriek that paralyzes any creature within 60 feet for 2d4 rounds if they fail a save. Once per day, a dust ghoul can animate 11d4 dust zombies. These zombies cannot be harmed by spells or weapons, but a gallon of water destroys them. The dust zombies attack with the ghouls to-hit bonus, but do no damage. If two hit the same opponent, they hold the creature immobile. Dust ghouls are immune to charms and sleep spells.

- Dust Ghoul: **HD** 4; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d4), 1 bite (1d4); **Move** 10/6/4 (flying/burrowing); **Save** 12; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Animate dust, paralyzing shriek

### Ghoul-Stirge

A ghoul-stirge resembles a large stirge with rotting flesh and broken wings. The origin of the ghoul-stirge has been lost, but it is believed to be the result of a failed magical experiment conducted in ages past by a group of evil and insane necromancers. Though they can generally be encountered anywhere, ghoul-stirges seem to favor desolate places such as ruins and caverns or dungeons deep underground. Being undead they do not have to eat, but seem to draw sustenance from the blood of enemies, much like a vampire.

Those hit by a ghoul-stirge’s bite attack must succeed on a saving throw or be paralyzed for 1d6+2 rounds. A ghoul-stirge can drain blood from a paralyzed or pinned opponent. Each round it deals 2d4 points of damage each round. Once the ghoul-stirge has dealt 8 points of damage, it flies off to digest its meal. If its victim dies before the ghoul-stirge’s appetite has been sated, the creature detaches and seeks a new target.

- Ghoul-Stirge: **HD** 4+1; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** Bite (1d6 plus parlaysis); **Move** 9/18 (flying); **Save** 13; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 7/600; **Special**: Blood drain, paralysis

### Giants

Giants are a staple of fantasy gaming, huge and dangerous creatures that often have a taste for human flesh. Most are not particularly intelligent.

#### Bronze Giant

A bronze giant is huge muscular being often mistaken for a statue of the gods. It is well proportioned and has flesh that gleams like polished bronze and hair the color of copper wire. Bronze giants stand about 25 feet tall and weigh about 14,000 pounds. A bronze giant can unleash a bellowing laugh that strikes fear (save negates) into the hearts of any creature within 100 feet that hears it. They throw rocks for 6d6 points of damage.

- Bronzer Giant: **HD** 12+1d6 hp; **AC** 1 \[18\]; **Atk** Sword (6d6); **Move** 15; **Save** 3; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 13/2300; **Special**: hurl boulders, sardonic laugh

#### Cave Giant

Cave giants are the dumber, stronger cousins of hill giants. A cave giant is a massive creature, stocky and pot-bellied, with black scraggly hair streaming down over its shoulders. The skin of a cave giant is gray, mottled here and there with blotches of brown and black. The face of a cave giant has a bulbous nose between glaring eyes with thick, bushy eyebrows. A cave giant has two tusk-like teeth that extend down over its lower lip, causing it to drool almost constantly. Cave giants don’t throw rocks, but instead try to grab victims and pound them into the ground, ceiling or any nearby objects.

- Cave Giant: **HD** 9+1d6 hp; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** weapon (2d8) or slam (1d8); **Move** 12; **Save** 6; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 9/1100; **Special**: none

**Cave Giant** from the [Tome of Horrors Complete](http://shop.d20pfsrd.com/products/sw-the-tome-of-horrors-complete), Copyright 2011, Necromancer Games, Inc., published and distributed by Frog God Games; Authors Scott Greene and Erica Balsley.

#### Cloud Giant

Cloud giants are cunning beasts, often living in cloud-castles in the sky (hence their name). They throw rocks for 6d6 hit points of damage. Cloud giants are famous for their ability to smell out food, enemies, and Englishmen.

- Cloud Giant: **HD** 12+1d4 hp; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 1 weapon (6d6); **Move** 15; **Save** 3; **AL** usually C; **CL/XP** 13/2300; **Special**: Hurl boulders.

#### Daimyo Giant

Daimyo Giants are perhaps improperly named: the term “Daimyo” is ordinarily used as a title, whereas the daimyo giants are a particular sub-race in their own right. However, they are so often found leading groups of other giants (and ogres, as seen below) that the use of the title fits them well. They tend to attract followings of other giant-type creatures, for their charisma – to giant and ogre races only – is always treated as 18 regardless of the giant’s true charisma as it would affect members of other races. Storm giants and titans are the exception to this rule; they not only do not find daimyo giants to be more than normally charismatic, but consider them to be irritatingly arrogant. Daimyo giants, for their part, avoid territories claimed by a storm giant or a titan, although with enough followers a daimyo giant might very well attempt to kill a storm giant.

Daimyo giants are slightly shorter but more powerfully muscled than cloud giants. They tend to have blue, yellow, or reddish-orange skin coloration, almost always with long, jet-black hair. They wield 10ft-long two-handed swords, with which they gain a +1 bonus to hit (the swords are not magical, merely well-honed). A daimyo giant will almost always (70%) be found with a small force of giant-retainers (see below), and if the giant does not have such a retinue it will be attended by 1d3+1 hill giants.

**d100 Retinue**
**01-20**: 1d3 cloud giants

In addition to any giant followers present, a daimyo giant will always have a retinue of ogre types in attendance: 1d3+1 ogre mages, 1d6+1 tusken ogres (q.v.), 1d6+4 ogres.

Daimyo giants are sometimes found occupying ancient ruins in the deep jungle; these will not have retinues of giant followers, but will have twice the normal number of ogre followers (of each type) and their lairs will also be protected by predatory cats and carnivorous apes.

A jack-in-irons can stomp its foot on the ground to cause powerful vibrations that radiate around the giant and cause opponents to fall down. The giant can throw rocks for 7d6 points of damage.

- Jack-in-Irons Giant: **HD** 16+1d6 hp; **AC** 0 \[19\]; **Atk** Club (7d6); **Move** 15; **Save** 3; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 17/2300; **Special**: none

#### Khmornian Giant

Khmornian giants are often found living in jungles, but they can be found in virtually any non-arctic terrain. These giants have four arms, and long tusks protruding from wide mouths. Their lairs are often guarded (90% chance) by 1d4 giant pythons.

Khmornian giants can throw rocks at a range up to 200ft, inflicting 2d10 points of damage; if they are not using any of their four arms in melee combat, these giants can hurl two such rocks per round.

The polyandrous female khmornian giants are found in a 1:3 ratio with the males. Females have only 9 hit dice, but they are considerably more dangerous than the males due to their spell casting and shapechanging abilities. All females are shamans with the spell casting ability of a 4th level cleric, and can shapeshift once per day into (and out of) a snakelike hybrid form. The snake hybrid has no significant difference from the normal form of the giantess, still having four arms, but the snake shape has an armor class of 2 and the shapeshift heals 50% of any damage suffered by the giantess prior to the change. Changing back to her normal shape also heals 50% of damage that was incurred while the giantess was in the snake-hybrid form.

Some extremely rare khmornian-giant females are sorceresses with the power of an 11th level magic-user; these individuals reside in well defended castles or ruined temples deep in the jungle. *(Author: Matt Finch)*

- Khmornian Giant (Male): **HD** 10+4; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 2 weapons (5d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 5; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 11/1700; **Special**: Hurl rocks.

#### Sand Giant

Sand giants are brutal, somewhat barbaric giants that prey on those weaker than themselves. They have dark tan skin, brown hair, and dark brown or dark green eyes. An adult male stands approximately 20 feet tall. Males tend to wear their hair and beards braided. Sand giants wear light clothes and light armor (if any). In times of battle or war, males may don chainmail. A typical sand giant’s bag contains food, 3d4 mundane items and no more than 12d10 coins. Sand Giants speak their own harsh rongue and the common tongue. They can live to be 500 years old.

Sand giants make their homes in warm desert lands away from human civilization. They live in tribes consisting of 8-9 families of 2-4 members each. On occasion, a tribe forms a raiding party that sets off to the nearest civilized place, returning at a later time with food, treasure and captives. For each adult in a sand giant’s lair, there is a 40% chance that the lair has 1d3 captives of a random humanoid race.

Once per day, a sand giant can form a volume of sand within 40 feet into the shape of a 20-foot long arm that ends in a clenched fist. The arm has a reach of 20 feet, AC 0 \[19\] and 30 hp. It can attack once per round as a 12 HD monster and deals 1d10 points of damage on each attack and any creature struck must succeed on a saving throw or be stunned for 1 round. The arm remains for 17 rounds. A sand giant does not need to concentrate to maintain the arm and can direct it to attack a new target without sacrificing its own attack. The arm loses shape if it is reduced to 0 or less hit points, the duration expires, or the sand giant dies.

Sand giant scan also cast the following spells: *Transmute rock to mud* (2/day), *move earth* (2/day) and *earthquake* (1/day).

- Sand Giant: **HD** 17; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** Two-handed sword (4d6) or 2 strikes (1d10); **Move** 15; **Save** 3; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 19/4100; **Special**: Shape earth, spells, rock catching

#### Sea Giant

Sea giants are bluish-green amphibious giants standing 10 feet tall and weighing about 6,000 pounds. Sea giants adorn themselves in loose flowing robes of white, blue, or green. Many wear wreathes of coral in their hair. Sea giants are the living embodiment of the sea’s bounty and destructive wrath. They can *control water* as per the spell five times per day. They can also increase the pressure of the water in a 10-foot radius around them for 5 rounds. Any creature in this denser water must save or take 1d8 points of damage from the crushing water. Sea giants can move freely in water without hindrances.

- Sea Giant: **HD** 14+1d6 hp; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** tridents (6d6); **Move** 15; **Save** 3; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 15/2300; **Special**: hurl boulders, magical abilities

#### Smoke Giant

This filthy giant resembles a 9-foot-tall humanoid with soot-colored skin. A smoke giant’s form is solid, but it can turn into a smoky form similar to *gaseous form*. The giant can cause a billowing smoke cloud to surround it at will. The giant can throw rocks for 2d6 points of damage.

- Smoke Giant: **HD** 8+1d6 hp; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** weapons (2d6); **Move** 15; **Save** 8; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 9/1100; **Special**: hurl boulders, immune to fire, smoke form, smoke cloud

#### Stone Giant

Stone giants dwell in caves, isolated in the mountain fastnesses. They throw rocks for 3d6 points of damage, and can be quite crafty in setting up ambushes in their native mountains. Travelers who wander into the territory of stone giants seldom return.

- Stone Giant: **HD** 9+3; **AC** 0 \[19\]; **Atk** 1 club (3d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 6; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 10/1400; **Special**: Throw boulders.

#### Storm Giant

Storm giants are the largest of giants, the most intelligent, the most magical, and the most likely to talk with humans rather than simply devour them. Storm giants can live in underwater sea-castles as well as on the heights of mountains. They throw boulders for 7d6 points of damage, and have the power to control weather (as per the spell).

- Storm Giant: **HD** 15+5; **AC** 1 \[18\]; **Atk** 1 weapon (6d6); **Move** 15; **Save** 3; **AL** any; **CL/XP** 16/3200; **Special**: Throw boulders, control weather.

#### Volcano Giant

A volcano giant is an 18-foot tall barrel-chested giant with black or brown hair and brown, black, or dark amber eyes. Its skin is leathery and tanned reddish-brown. The hair of a volcano giant is tough and wiry, with the strength and texture of copper. Three times per day, a volcano giant can exhale a cloud of sulfuric gas in a 30-foot cone. This gas causes creatures who fail a save to succumb to fits of coughing and choking. Volcano giants can throw rocks for 2d8 points of damage. Volcano giants are immune to fire.

- Volcano Giant: **HD** 14+1d6 hp; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 1 weapon (4d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 3; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 16/3200; **Special**: Hurl boulders, breath weapon, immune to fire

#### Wood Giant

*This giant resembles a wood elf of about 10 feet tall. It has brownish-green skin, a bald head, and bright green eyes.*

Wood giants are peaceful, good-natured giants found in the forested areas of the world. The average wood giant stands 9 feet tall, weighs 900 pounds, and resembles a large wood elf. Wood giants have brownish-green skin, bright green eyes, large heads and prominent jaws; their elf-like ears sit high on their long, oval heads. Most wood giants (particularly males) are bald. Wood giants dress in greens or browns and prefer neutral colors to the bright or dull colors of other races. Wood giants speak their own language and the language of elfs, and may also speak common. Wood giants can live to be 400 years old. Three times per day, a wood giant can alter its form so as to appear as any humanoid creature between 3 feet and 15 feet tall.

Wood giants are on friendly terms with most benign creatures of the forest, particularly wood elves. Though contact outside their immediate clan is rare, they do occasionally have dealings with nearby tribes of wood elves. Wood giant villages are large and open expanses of land with few if any buildings or shelters. Wood giants prefer to spend their time under the warmth of the day and the serenity of the night. They do not associate with—and usually attack on sight—evil forest creatures. The leaders of wood giant clans might have the abilities of 1st to 3rd level rangers.

- Wood Giant: **HD** 7; **AC** 1 \[18\]; **Atk** Two-handed sword (2d8) or longbow (2d6); **Move** 15; **Save** 9 (7 vs. charm); **AL** L; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: Change self, surprise on roll of 1-3 on 1d6

### Giant Slug of P'Nahk

P’Nahki slugs are massive, translucent creatures. The only clearly visible part of the slug’s anatomy is the disturbingly human-looking brain suspended in the slug’s body, appearing at first glance to be floating in the air. These creatures originated in a forgotten place called P’Nahk; whether this was a ruined city, a lost world, or an entirely different dimension is not known.

The giant slugs of P’Nahk are highly intelligent, although this intellect is seldom put to use in a way that can be related to human motivation or logic. All P’Nahki slugs have ESP ability. Three times per day, a giant P’Nahki slug can issue forth a blast of insanity in a cone shape 60ft long, expanding to a width of 60ft at the far end. Anyone within the area of the blast must make a saving throw or be affected as follows:

**d100 Effect**
**01-25**: frozen by fear for 1d4+1 rounds; the character will (and must) fight back against a direct assault but can take no other action
**26-50**: insane rage for 1d4+1 rounds; the character attacks any former allies in a frenzy of hatred
**51-75**: self-hatred for 1d4+1 rounds; the character drops any held items and claws at his/her own body, inflicting 1hp of damage per round.
**76-00**: adoration for 1d4+1 rounds; the character drops all held items, falls to the floor, and grovels in worship of the slug.

Because of their translucency, giant slugs of P’Nahk surprise opponents with a 1-3 on 1d6. Their rubbery bodies are immune to damage from blunt weapons. *(Author: Matt Finch)*

- Giant Slug of P'Nahk: **HD** 8; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 1 bite (2d8); **Move** 9; **Save** 8; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 11/1700; **Special**: Surprise on 1-3, blast of insanity, immune to blunt weapons.

### Gibbering Mouther

Gibbering mouthers are amorphous blobs of flesh with multiple eyes and mouths appearing and disappearing from the quivering mass of the body as it moves along. The mouths gibber and babble meaningless, speech-like noises; the monster is perpetually accompanied by this disturbing and inhuman sound except when it is waiting to ambush prey, in which case the eyes and mouths are all kept closed, and the monster appears to be nothing more than an oozy pile of earth. When the mouther spots prey, it begins gibbering loudly, causing anyone within 60ft to make a saving throw or become confused (per the spell). Each round spent listening to the mouther requires another saving throw. In any given round, the mouther will have six mouths available either to spit or to bite. The creature’s spittle flashes brightly upon impact with most surfaces, causing anyone nearby to make a saving throw or be blinded for one round. The mouther’s bites are not particularly deadly in and of themselves, but once a mouth hits it fastens on and continues to do automatic damage thereafter. Also, if a character has 3 or more mouths fastened to him, there is a risk of slipping and being covered by the mouther (which allows the mouther to attack with 12 additional mouths on its underside). The chance of slipping is 5%, and if more than 3 mouths are attached the chance increases by 5% per additional mouth. The ground around a gibbering mouther, in a radius of 5-ft, will be soft and mud-like, for the mouther changes the consistency of the ground beneath itself.

- Gibbering Mouther: **HD** 4+4; **AC** 1 \[18\]; **Atk** 6 mouths (1hp); **Move** 3; **Save** 13; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 6/400; **Special**: Gibbering, spit, pull prey underneath.

### Gillmonkey

Gillmonkeys are nasty, monkey-like creatures that live in the sea. They have hairless, pinkish-brown skin and short tentacle-like growths on the top of the head. They attack in packs, sometimes swarming over a ship’s rail.

- Gillmonkey: **HD** 1d6hp; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d4), 2 claws (1hp); **Move** 6 (Swim 12); **Save** 18; **AL** C; **CL/XP** B/10; **Special**: Breathe underwater.

### Glass Butterfly

Glass Butterflies are tiny, wizard-made entities, made of colored glass and resembling butterflies the size of a bird or cat. They were once made as decoration for the noble houses of antiquity, and are usually found in large numbers flitting aimlessly about. Glass Butterflies will usually ignore any creature that comes near them, and simply fly a few feet away if attacked. They are constantly in motion, creating a pleasant play of light and color if there is a light source present, and only touch the ground when destroyed. Being mindless, they are unaffected by spells such as sleep, charm, and hold. They are otherwise extremely susceptible to damage, and can be easily destroyed. However, the magic that animates a Glass Butterfly is too powerful to be contained in such a frail and simple vessel. When slain, there is a burst of energy in a 2ft radius. This does not cause damage, but has a cumulative chance of causing a random spell effect, equal to 5% per Glass Butterfly destroyed in the past turn. Whenever the percentage reaches 100%, it resets to 0%. If caught in an area effect, 1 Glass Butterfly is destroyed per dice of damage, and one damage die is rolled to determine how many additional Glass Butterflies are destroyed. Any Light spell cast upon a Glass Butterfly is increased by 50% in both duration and area of effect. (*Author:* *Scott Wylie Roberts, “Myrystyr”)*

- Glass Butterfly: **HD** 1d4hp; **AC** 9 \[10\]; **Atk** none; **Move** (Fly 20); **Save** 18; **AL** N; **CL/XP** A/5; **Special**: chance of random spell discharge upon death

### Glass Wyrm

This semi-transparent dragon appears to be formed of crystal or glass. Its large wings are translucent and the sound of grating glass can be heard when it moves. It breathes razor-sharp shards of glass in a 60-foot-long cone that is roughly 30 feet wide at the base. Any light source brought within 30 feet of a glass dragon’s reflective surface causes the light to reflect as a burst that blinds all creatures within 30 feet for 1d6 rounds unless a save is made. Spells that target a glass dragon have a 50% chance of reflecting in a random direction.

- Glass Wyrm: **HD** 5-7; **AC** 1 \[18\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d6), 1 bite (3d6); **Move** 9/24 (flying); **Save** 12, 11 , or 9; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 5 HD (8/800); 6 HD (9/1100), 7 HD (10/1400); **Special**: Breathes shards of glass

### Glimmer

Glimmers are shapes of greenish or yellowish light, with a slight resemblance to will-o-wisps. They are generally found in dismal swamps and marshes, but can also be found in natural caverns as well. Looking directly at a glimmer requires that the observer make a saving throw or become confused, as per the spell, for 2d6 rounds. Glimmers attack by flashing a blast of magical cold at an opponent, causing 2d6 hit points of damage (saving throw for half damage). Glimmers are immune to both fire and cold. (*Author: Matt Finch)*

- Glimmer: **HD** 6; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** cold blast (2d6); **Move** (Fly 9); **Save** 11; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: Confusion, immune to fire and cold.

### Glitterskull

The Glitterskull is a gold-plated skull, with large red gems set into the eye sockets. It flies by magical levitation, and is surrounded by a reddish halo. This halo is of magical flame, and causes a roaring sound when the creature is flying about. It also sheds light in a 15-ft. radius, and at a distance may be mistaken for torchlight. The skull is that of a wizard, usually but not always human. A glitterskull has the spellcasting ability of a level 8 magic-user, and does not require a spellbook to regain its daily spells. Being a former wizard, the glitterskull prefers to attack by casting spells, but it may also fly at opponents, ramming into them for 1d6 damage. Its fiery halo does not cause extra damage, but may ignite flammable objects. Glitterskulls can only be harmed by magical weapons. They can catch a Magic Missile spell within their eyes, and hurl it back at the caster the following round (instead of attacking) or use the spell energy to heal themselves (spell damage adding to HP). Glitterskulls are also immune to poison and gas attacks, and take only half damage from fire-based attacks.

The glitterskull is capable of speech, and retains much of the intelligence of its former life. While it may parley with strong parties, the mind trapped inside a glitterskull has been warped by the millennia, and most utter little more than mocking laughter and scornful commentary. The gems and gold plating of a glitterskull may be worth anywhere from 200 to 1,200 GP, in addition to other treasure. (*Author: Scott Wylie Roberts, “Myrystyr”)*

- Glitterskull: **HD** 8; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 1 ram (1d6); **Move** (Fly 18); **Save** 8; **AL** C: **CL/XP** 13/2300; **Special**: Spells (as level 8 magic-user), immune to non-magical weapons, immune to poison and gases, half damage from fire.

### Gloom Crawler

Gloom crawlers resemble giant squid with many, 5-foot-long tentacles that end in a small, round, lidless eye with a stark blue pupil. These many eyes let it see in all directions at once, and let it sense the location of anything within 60 feet that is touching the ground. If a gloom crawler hits with a tentacle, it grabs the victim and constricts for automatic damage in the rounds thereafter until the creature is freed. Gloom crawlers take 1d4 points of damage from natural sunlight.

- Gloom Crawler: **HD** 10; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 10 tentacles (1d6 plus constrict), bite (2d8); **Move** 9; **Save** 5; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 11/1700; **Special**: Constrict, all-around senses, vulnerable to sunlight

### Gloomwing

Gloomwings look like a giant moths with black wings covered in spiraled patterns of silver. Eight legs run the length of the their bodies, each ending in a pearly-white claw. Their mouths have two large pearly-white mandibles. The gloomwing is native to the Plane of Shadow and is summoned to the Material Plane by spellcasters to act as a guardian. On occasion, a gloomwing slips through a tear in the fabric of the planes and enters the Material Plane on its own. The ivory mandibles of a gloomwing can be pried or broken from its carcass and sold for 100 gp each.

The coloration on the gloomwing’s back and wings provide it with protection against some predators. Any creature viewing the gloomwing from above must succeed on a saving throw or be affected as if by a *confusion* spell for 6 rounds.

After the first round of combat, a gloomwing can emit a scent in a 30-foot radius that weakens living creatures in the area. An affected creature can make a saving throw each round it remains in the area to negate the effects. Otherwise, they suffer a -1 penalty on melee attacks and melee damage. The pheromone ceases when the gloomwing dies. Strength damage dealt by a gloomwing’s pheromone heals at a rate of 1 point per hour. Each round a gloomwing emits its weakness pheromone there is a 20% chance that 1d4 additional gloomwings arrive in the area and join the battle.

Female gloomwings lay their eggs in the bodies of slain victims. In 12 days, these eggs hatch, releasing 1d6+3 tenebrous worms. The young emerge about 2 weeks later as a tenebrous worms (see that entry), literally devouring the host from inside. While implanted, a body cannot be brought back to life except by the casting of a *wish*. If *cure disease* is cast on the body, the eggs are destroyed and the body can be raised normally.

- Gloomwing: **HD** 5; **AC** 0 \[19\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d4), bite (1d8); **Move** 3/15 (flying); **Save** 12; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 9/1100; **Special**: Confusion, implant, weakness pheromone, summon gloomwings

### Glurm (Zen Frog)

Intelligent frog-like humanoids, Glurm can usually be found sitting in meditation or study amid scenes of natural beauty. They wear simple loincloths and will have a bamboo staff within arm’s reach. Their dwellings are of woven reeds, and contain only a few simple items. If there are several glurm in the area, there will be a “place of harmony” near a stream or river. This will be a cleared expanse of sand, dotted with boulders to sit upon; the glurm come here to discuss philosophy and practice their martial arts.

The spiritual studies of the glurm have given them mystical powers, and they practice martial arts, accounting for their armor class. Glurm are pacifists, and if threatened will attempt to drive off foes with an intimidating display of martial arts. All onlookers within 30ft must make a saving throw or back away for 1 round. If forced into combat, a glurm’s unarmed strikes cause 1d4 damage; opponents of equal or smaller size can only act after the glurm in the following round if the glurm inflicts maximum damage. Armed with a bamboo staff, a glurm can focus its spiritual energy for a +2 bonus to damage; in addition, if the attack roll is 4 or more higher than required to hit, the glurm may disarm a foe, trip them up, or perform a similar manuever. In an open area, the glurm may also use its staff to make a pole-vault kick against an opponent up to 10ft away, possibly knocking them down. Lastly, the glurm has the abilities of a level 3 cleric.

Any treasure possessed by the glurm will generally be in the form of scrolls discoursing on obscure philosophical topics, and finely crafted writing materials. (*Author: Scott Wylie Roberts, “Myrystyr”)*

- Glurm (Zen [frog](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Frogs)): **HD** 3+2; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 1 unarmed strike (1d4) or 1 bamboo staff (1d6+2); **Move** 12; **Save** 14; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Martial arts, spells as level 3 cleric (2 level 1 spells).

### Gnarlwood

A gnarlwood resembles a treant but instead of the kindly, gentle face of the tree-folk its face is twisted into a grim scowl. Its deep-set eyes and jagged mouth give it an almost skull-like grimace and its four twisted arms are tipped in sharp woody claws. Its leaves are deep green, almost black, and have ghostly white markings on them. Behind it, the skeletal remains of unfortunate animals shamble through the undergrowth. A gnarlwood exudes a 20-foot radius *protection from good* around it, and can *animate dead* within 60 feet at will. If a gnarlwood hits a single opponent with two branches, it grabs the creature and does an additional 1d6 points of damage as it rends the victim’s flesh.

- Gnarlwood: **HD** 11; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 4 branches (2d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 4; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 10/1400; **Special**: magical abilities, animate dead, rend, protection aura

### Gnoll

Gnolls are tall humanoids with hyena-like heads. They may be found both above ground and in subterranean caverns. They form into loosely organized clans, often ranging far from home in order to steal and kill with rapacious ferocity.

- Gnoll: **HD** 2; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 1 bite (2d4) or weapon (1d10); **Move** 9; **Save** 16; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 2/30; **Special**: None.

### Goat, Giant

Giant goats include giant mountain goats. These creatures are as large as a pony, and can be ridden.

- Giant Goat: **HD** 3; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 1 gore (2d6); **Move** 18; **Save** 14; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**: +4 damage on charge.

### Goblins

#### Goblin

Goblins are small creatures (4 ft tall or so) that inhabit dark woods, underground caverns, and (possibly) the otherworldly realms of the fey. They attack at -1 in the full sunlight.

- Goblin: **HD** 1d6hp; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 1 weapon (1d6); **Move** 9; **Save** 18; **AL** C; **CL/XP** B/10; **Special**: -1 to hit in sunlight.

#### Goblin, Belfry

Belfry goblins appear to be related to the other goblinoid species, but they have wing membranes which run from their arms down their sides, quite similar to flying squirrels. These membranes grant the belfry goblin the ability to glide, and in no way inhibit the ability of their hands to manipulate objects. Hanging upside down on the ceiling in dark corners, belfry goblins are all but invisible, waiting for their prey to pass by and then attacking with a deadly swooping attack, a javelin in each hand, doing double damage on a successful hit with the swooping attack. If the swoop attack succeeds on a “to hit” roll of 18 or better, the belfry goblin does additional damage as it passes by, raking with its foot claws for an additional 1d6 damage. A belfry goblin has 2 attacks per round, with any combination of its hand held weapon, claws, or bite. The bite of a belfry goblin is dangerous in much the same way as a rat bite, with a 5% chance per bite the victim will contract a disease. Diseased victims will sicken and die within 1d6 days, unless the victim rolls a saving throw.

For every 20 belfry goblins encountered there will be a leader with the maximum of 9 hit points and who attacks as a 2 HD creature. If a nest of 40 or more individuals is found, there will be a chieftain with 2+2 HD who attacks as a 3 HD monster. The chieftain will have an honor guard of 4 particularly fearsome warriors whose stats are equal to that of the leader type. There is also at least a 15% chance that in any belfry goblin encounter there will be a vampiric variant present. The chance to encounter these special vampiric belfry goblins increases to 30% for standard lairs and 60% for nests of 40 or more. (*Author: Cameron DuBeers and the Lizard of Oz)*

- Belfry [Goblin](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Goblins): **HD** 1; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 2 attacks from claws (1d6), weapons (1d6), and/or 1 bite (1d4); **Move** 6 (Glide 12); **Save** 17; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 2/30; **Special**: Swooping attack, chance of disease.

#### Goblin, Belfry (Vampiric)

These creatures are physically weaker and lighter in coloration than the standard belfry goblin, having only 1-1 HD, but they are able to gain strength from drinking the blood of their victims. On a successful bite attack, the vampiric belfry goblin sucks blood from its victim for 1d4 points of damage, wrapping its arms and legs around the victim and holding them fast. Each subsequent round, the victim must break the grip or the vampiric belfry goblin automatically drains an additional 1d4 hit points of blood drain; the chance to break the grip is 30%. Vampiric belfry goblins gain temporary bonus hit points from blood they drink, gaining 1 hp for every 1 hit point drained from a victim, up to double its normal number of hit points. Once the vampiric belfry goblin exceeds its normal hit points, it gains +1 to hit and damage. (*Author: Cameron DuBeers and the Lizard of Oz)*

#### Goblin, Oni-Aka (Asian Red Goblin)

The Oni-aka (red goblins) are short, scaly humanoids with small horns on their slightly pointed heads. They have coarse black hair, and coal black eyes. These evil beings are known to raid villages to steal slaves and cattle. They are typically armed with clubs and short spears they use for throwing. These goblins are said to have been born of fire in the pits of the earth; and as such they are almost impervious to fire damage, suffering only half normal damage from any fire-based attack. Note that these goblins are from Asian mythology, and might not be related to normal goblins in anything but name. *(Author: MikeD)*

- Oni-aka (Red [Goblin](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Goblins)): **HD** 1; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 1 weapon (1d6); **Move** 9; **Save** 17; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 1/15; **Special**: Fire resistant.

#### Goblin, Oni-Kage (Asian Shadow Goblin)

The Oni-kage (shadow goblins) are short, black-skinned humanoids with large, pale eyes, dwellers of dark caves and deep bamboo thickets. All oni-kage detest bright lights, and they suffer -1 penalties to combat in daylight. They have keen night vision, and their somewhat supernatural nature makes them completely invisible in darkness (visible only by use of spells). Note that these goblins are from Asian mythology, and might not be related to normal goblins in anything but name. (*Author: MikeD)*

- Oni-kage: **HD** 1; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 1 weapon (1d6); **Move** 9; **Save** 17; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 2/30; **Special**: -1 penalty in daylight, Invisible in darkness.

#### Goblin, Oni-Yama (Asian Mountain Goblin)

The oni-yama are hairless, grey-skinned humanoids with short tusks protruding from their mouths. They are smaller than ogres, but much larger and bulkier than men -- though their distinctively hunched posture makes them appear somewhat smaller than they really are. These big goblins dwell in remote mountain caves and forgotten ruins, often preying upon merchants and travelers passing through their territories. In general, they arm themselves with such weapons as they can take from their victims, for they are not industrious. They wear an assortment of armor, usually misused but still functional. The oni-yama bully, and often enslave, lesser goblins. Despite their size, the oni-yama are extremely stealthy on their great, flat feet, and gain surprise on a roll of 1-3 on a d6. Note that these goblins are from Asian mythology, and might not be related to normal goblins in anything but name. (*Author: MikeD)*

- Oni-yama: **HD** 2; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 1 weapon (1d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 16; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 2/30; **Special**: 50% chance to gain surprise attacks.

#### Goblin, Redcap (Chaos Goblin)

Redcaps (or chaos goblins) are goblins driven mad by the insidious effects of raw Chaos, reducing them to a bestial state. Utterly devoid of empathy with any living creature, including ordinary goblins, redcaps delight in inflicting pain. Indeed, redcaps derive a strange form of sustenance from doing so. Any successful attack a redcap achieves heals it for an amount equal to the amount of damage it deals to its target. Worse yet, a redcap can double its total hit points in this manner. Thus, a undamaged redcap with 5 hit points who manages to deal 3 points of damage on its attack will now have 8 hit points and, assuming it continues to remain undamaged, can be “healed” for another 2 hit points before reaching its maximum potential hit points. Though thoroughly insane, redcaps work well with others of their kind, forming predatory packs that attack any creature they can find. Redcaps often take gruesome souvenirs of their victims, such as fingers, ears, and eyeballs, which they use to adorn themselves. Many also use the blood of their prey to dye their tattered clothing, including their hats, the practice of which gave these foul aberrations their common name. (*Author: James Malizsewski)*

- Redcap: **HD** 1d6hp; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d6); **Move** 9; **Save** 17; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 1/15; **Special**: Vicious healing, -1 to hit in sunlight.

### Gohl (Hydra Cloud)

A gohl is a 10-foot-wide, 10-foot-high, blob of mottled black and gray flesh, slimy and rubbery to the touch. From its central form sprout six long tentacles of brownish flesh and three snake-like heads, each head perched atop a long, thin neck. Each head is gold with red eyes and has a wide mouth lined with double rows of needle-sharp teeth. Many small tendrils appear from the gohl’s central form at random intervals only to disappear back into its massive trunk. A gohl tries to grab victim in its tentacles. If an opponent is struck by two or more tentacles in the same round, he is constricted and takes 1d6+3 damage each round thereafter. Creatures held by a tentacle are pulled toward the creature’s mouth. The toxic bite of a gohl deals 1d8 points of acid damage.

- Gohl: **HD** 12; **AC** -1 \[20\]; **Atk** 6 tentacles (1d6+3) and 3 acidic bites (1d8+3); **Move** 15 (flying); **Save** 3; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 13/2300; **Special**: Acid, constrict, +1 magic weapons to hit

### Golden Cat

A gohl is a 10-foot-wide, 10-foot-high, blob of mottled black and gray flesh, slimy and rubbery to the touch. From its central form sprout six long tentacles of brownish flesh and three snake-like heads, each head perched atop a long, thin neck. Each head is gold with red eyes and has a wide mouth lined with double rows of needle-sharp teeth. Many small tendrils appear from the gohl’s central form at random intervals only to disappear back into its massive trunk. A gohl tries to grab victim in its tentacles.

### Golems

Golems are man-shaped creatures built to serve their masters, usually powerful wizards or high priests. They are often used as guardians. Golems cannot be hit with non-magical weapons, and are immune to the sorts of spells used to create them (iron golems being immune to fire, for instance). You can find the details in the specific monster descriptions.

#### Blood Golem

This creature looks like a hideous, bloated slug, blood red in color. Two long spindly arms protrude from its upper body. It has no other discernible features. Contrary to their name, blood golems are not constructs, but rather slug-shaped clots of living blood animated by a dark and ancient ritual. A typical blood golem is 10 feet long and weighs 700 pounds.

Each time a blood golem hits a living opponent with an attack, it gains a number of hit points equal to the damage dealt. These bonus hit points are added to the blood golem’s total. When a blood golem absorbs enough blood to raise its hit points to the maximum for its HD, it splits into two identical blood golems, each with half the original’s hit points. For example, a 6 HD blood golem that reaches 48 hit points splits into two 6 HD blood golems with 24 hit points each.

If a blood golem successfully hits an opponent with both of its slam attacks in a single round, that opponent suffers catastrophic blood expulsion, taking 2d4 points of constitution damage (saving throw for half). A blood golem gains 3 hit points per point of constitution damage it deals.

A blood golem is *slowed* (as the spell) for 1d4 rounds by any cold-based attacks or effects. A *purify food and water* spell deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level to a blood golem. A blood golem can attempt a saving throw to reduce the damage by half.

- Blood [Golem](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Golems): **HD** 6 (25hp); **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 2 strikes (1d8 plus blood consumption); **Move** 12; **Save** 11; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 9/1100; **Special**: Blood consumption, cell division, +1 or better weapon to hit, regenerate (2 hp/rd), immune to mind-affecting abilities, resistance to fire (50%).

#### Clay Golem

The “original” golem of folklore, clay golems may be created by Clerics or powerful priests. They are massive clay statues of human beings, imbued with a rudimentary intelligence and the ability to move and follow their masters’ commands. For each round of combat, a clay golem has a 1% chance (cumulative) to go berserk, leaving its master’s control and attacking enemies and allies alike. Clay golems are not damaged by slashing or piercing weapons. They are immune to all spells other than those affecting earth, and these have very diminished effects – with one exception. An earthquake spell may be used to utterly destroy a clay golem.

#### Flagstone Golem

A flagstone golem is composed of large flat stones and bricks jointed and fitted together so as to allow the creature to fold itself flat. A flagstone golem stands 10 feet tall and weighs 1,200 pounds. Spells that affect rock are the only ones that affect flagstone golems. Any energy-based (acid, fire, cold, electricity) attack that directly effects a flagstone golem is absorbed into its body dealing no damage. A flagstone golem can use the absorbed energy to repair itself, healing 1 hit point for every 3 points of damage the attack would have otherwise dealt. Or it can release the energy in a 30-foot cone that deals 3d8 points of damage to all within the area. An opponent can save to reduce the damage by half.

#### Flesh Golem

A creation stitched together from human limbs and other parts, a flesh golem is similar to Frankenstein’s monster. Only +1 or better magic weapons can harm a flesh golem, and it is slowed by fire and cold spells. Lightning heals the golem for the number of points of damage that it would normally inflict. No other type of spell affects a flesh golem.

#### Furnace Golem

Furnace golems are 20-foot-tall suits of black iron armor with a large grate opening in their abdomen covering roaring flames. The fires are magical and cannot be extinguished. Once every 1d4 rounds, the golem belches forth a 50-foot line of fire that does 10d6 points of damage (save for half). If a furnace golem hits a single opponent with 2 slams, it grabs the opponent (save avoids) and shoves the victim into its furnace interior (2d6 damage per round while trapped). Cold-based spells slow the golem (as per the *slow* spell), while fire spells restore hit points. No other type of spell affects a furnace golem.

- Furnace [Golem](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Golems): **HD** 18 (75 hp); **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 2 slams (4d8 + fire); **Move** 6; **Save** 3; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 20/4400; **Special**: Breath weapon, fire heals, cold slows, +2 weapons to hit, immune to most spells

#### Gelatinous Golem

A gelatinous golem is a humanoid-shaped, semi-transparent amoeba that stands 8 feet tall and weighs 600 pounds. It has rudimentary intelligence. A gelatinous golem secretes an anesthetizing slime that paralyzes opponents for 2d4 rounds who fail a save. If a gelatinous golem hits an opponent with both fists, it can decide to engulf the opponent automatically on the next round. An engulfed opponent takes 1d6 points of damage each round from the the gelatinous golem’s acid each round it remains trapped. Attacks on a gelatinous golem deal half their damage to anyone engulfed by the creature. Cold slows a gelatinous golem. It is immune to all other spells.

#### Glass Golem

A glass golem is a human-shaped statue of glass that has been animated by a captured spirit infused into its physical substance. These creatures are immune to all spells other than cold-based magic, which has the effect of a slow spell but does not damage the golem. Blunt weapons inflict double damage against them, and they can be hit by normal weapons. A glass golem glitters brilliantly unless it is in total darkness, capturing and reflecting light by a thousand-fold. Anyone looking upon a glass golem, even through a mirror, must make a saving throw or attack at -2 to hit. *(Conversion by Matt Finch, first appearing in* **Black Monastery** *by* **Frog God Games**)

#### Ice Golem

A gelatinous golem is a humanoid-shaped, semi-transparent amoeba that stands 8 feet tall and weighs 600 pounds. It has rudimentary intelligence. A gelatinous golem secretes an anesthetizing slime that paralyzes opponents for 2d4 rounds who fail a save. If a gelatinous golem hits an opponent with both fists, it can decide to engulf the opponent automatically on the next round. An engulfed opponent takes 1d6 points of damage each round from the the gelatinous golem’s acid each round it remains trapped.

#### Iron Golem

Iron golems are huge moving statues of iron. They can breathe a 10-foot-radius cloud of poison gas as well as attacking with great power. Weapons of +2 or less do not affect iron golems. These hulking statues are slowed by lightning spells, but fire-based spells actually restore hit points to them. No other type of spell affects them.

- Iron [Golem](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Golems): **HD** 16 (80hp); **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 1 weapon or fist (4d10); **Move** 6; **Save** 3; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 17/3500; **Special**: Poison gas, immune to all weapons +2 or less, slowed by lightning, healed by fire, immune to most magic.

#### Iron Maiden Golem

An iron maiden golem is a hollow torture device. The golem appears as a tall, well-muscled male or female warrior. An iron maiden golem has articulated arms and legs. If an iron maiden golem hits a victim with two slams, it must save or become trapped inside the golem. Trapped creatures take 20 points of damage each round from the dagger-like blades inside the lid. A creature slain inside the golem transforms into a zombie. Only +2 or better magic weapons can harm an iron maiden golem, and it is slowed by lightning spells. Fire-based spells heal the golem. No other type of spell affects an iron maiden golem.

#### Magnesium Golem

A magnesium golem is a silvery-white humanoid formed of magnesium standing 6-7 feet tall and weighing 600 pounds. The magnesium golem’s features are smooth and perfect, though it has no discernible ears, nose, or mouth. Its eyes are indentations in its face. A 10-foot aura of sickness radiates around the magnesium golem that sickens any creature it hits or that gets near it (save avoids). This sickness lasts for 1d4 turns. Water-based spells slow a magnesium golem (as per the slow spell), while fire-based spells heal the golem. They are immune to all other spells, and +1 weapons are required to hit them.

- Magnesium [Golem](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Golems): **HD** 7; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 2 slams (2d6+1); **Move** 6; **Save** 9; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 9/1100; **Special**: Sickness, +1 weapons to hit, immune to most spells

#### Mummy Golem

A mummy golem stands 6 feet tall and weighs 300 pounds. Its body is composed of tightly knotted and rolled bandages held together by magic (and more bandages). A mummy golem can wrap bandages from its body around a grappled foe’s throat. The bandages can come from anywhere on its body, not just its arm or hand, so the mummy golem can continue using its fist. A strangled creature takes 1d6 points of damage each round. A mummy golem can strangle a maximum of 4 opponents. Fire and fire-based spells affect mummy golems normally. They are immune to all other spells.

- Mummy [Golem](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Golems): **HD** 9 (55 hit points); **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 2 fists (1d8); **Move** 10; **Save** 6; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 10/1400; **Special**: Hit only by +1 magic weapons, immune to most spells, constriction

#### Ooze Golem

Ooze golems are 10-foot-tall amorphous creatures of swirling colors that can alter their shape to appear roughly humanoid. Their natural form resembles a column or pillar with two large pseudopods extending from its central trunk that function as arms. In humanoid form, an ooze golem’s lower torso ends in two powerful legs, and the creature can flatten its body to squeeze through cracks up to 2 inches in size. An ooze golem secretes a deadly acid that deals an extra 1d6 points of damage with each hit. Spells don’t affect ooze golems. When killed, an ooze golem explodes in a burst of acid that does 2d6 points of damage to all within 10 feet (save for half).

- Ooze [Golem](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Golems): **HD** 10; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 2 slams (2d8 + 1d6 acid); **Move** 6; **Save** 5; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 10/1400; **Special**: Acid, death throes, immune to blunt weapons, immune to most spells, regenerate 2 hp/round

#### Rope Golem

A rope golem is a tangled mess of knotted and bundled ropes in roughly humanoid form. The typical rope golem stands 7 feet tall but weighs only about 100 pounds. Its long, gangly arms end in noose-like hands. Until it is activated, a rope golem appears to be nothing more than a pile of normal ropes. If a rope golem hits the same opponent with 2 slams, it twists the foe into its ropy clutches to strangle him for 1d8 damage for each round thereafter. A rope golem takes one and a half damage from all fire-based spells. *Rope trick* deals 1d6 points of damage. They are immune to all other spells.

#### Stone Golem

Stone golems are massive stone statues animated by very powerful magics (much more than just animate object, in other words). They are slowed by fire spells, damaged by rock-to-mud spells, and healed by the reverse. Spells that affect rock, and fire spells, are the only ones that affect stone golems. They can only be hit by +2 or better weapons.

- Stone [Golem](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Golems): **HD** 12 (60hp); **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 1 fist (3d8); **Move** 6; **Save** 3; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 16/3200; **Special**: +1 or better magic weapon to hit, immune to most magic.

#### Stone Guardian Golem

Stone guardians are sometimes referred to as lesser stone golems. It resembles a stocky humanoid formed of mud and stone. Stone guardians are often used as guardians by their creators. When the stone guardian is first constructed, the creator crafts a magical ring that offers himself (or anyone to whom he gives the ring) protection from that stone guardian. A stone guardian can see invisible creatures.

A stone guardian’s body is constructed from mud mixed with rare herbs and powders worth at least
500 gp. A large chunk of stone inserted into the chest cavity functions as its “heart.” The magical ring that links a stone guardian is constructed at the same time and costs 300 gp to create.

#### Tallow Golem

The tallow golem is a humanoid construct composed entirely of wax. It bears no facial features unless the creator chooses to render a lifelike “wax dummy,” in which case the golem can appear quite real indeed. Wizards who specialize in the creation of tallow golems refer to themselves as “chandlers.” Unlike other golem-sculptors, chandlers consider their work a form of art. The golem wears whatever clothing (if any) that its creator desires, usually rags or trousers. It has no possessions and no weapons. The golem cannot speak or utter any sound. It moves slowly, but relentlessly.

A creature hit by both of a tallow golem’s slam attacks in a single round must pass a saving throw or be pinned. A tallow golem can break down and absorb chemicals from a pinned victim, dealing 1d12 points of damage each round the pin is maintained. Additionally, this causes skin discoloration. The victim must make a successful saving throw or lose 1 point of charisma permanently.

The tallow golem is formed from a large block of candle wax mixed with special powders worth at least 500 gp.

#### Wax Golem

Wax Golems are among the simplest type of golem to create. Their bodies are carved out of tallow or wax and imbued with the same basic level of intelligence as the more powerful Clay Golem. Unlike their stronger kin, Wax Golems have no chance of going berserk, nor are they automatically immune to spells. They do possess magic resistance of 25% and cannot be hit by non-magic weapons. Because of the pliable nature of their bodies, Wax Golems easily absorb the force delivered by blunt weapons and only take half damage from those sources. Slashing and piercing weapons inflict normal damage to Wax Golems. Fire and heat that damage the golem will inflict twice normal damage. (*Author: Andrew Trent)*

#### Witch-Doll Golem

A witch-doll golem appears to be crafted from stuffed human skin dressed in a patchwork of ill-fitting clothes. Large needles and pins pierce the creature’s body where a humanoid’s vital organs would be. A witch-doll golem stands twice the height of a human and weighs about 1,000 pounds. A witch-doll golem can be commanded to target a specific foe. Against that foe, the witch-doll golem deals an extra 1d8 points of damage with each fist. Once the golem hits its intended target, half of any further damage the witch-doll golem takes is transferred to the victim so long as they are within 60 feet of each other. Only the linked target can attack a witch-doll golem and not take “linked damage.” Witch-doll golems take full damage from fire and do not pass this damage to their linked target. They are immune to all other spells.

#### Wood Golem

Arcane spellcasters used several ancient texts to arrive at a process to create inexpensive yet still quite powerful golems. They had master craftsmen create wood statues with articulating limbs and then performed the proper spells to animate and control them. The statues vary in shape and form and usually have weapons of some sort held in each hand. The wood golems were designed to act both as an alarm and a protection against intruders. Wood golems let out a piercing howl that lasts for 6 rounds when anyone other than its creator enters the area it is guarding or comes within 50 feet of the golem. This howl can be heard to a range of 100 feet. The pieces of a wood golem are assembled from blocks of fine wood and sprinkled with rare powders and crushed herbs worth at least 300 gp.

- Wood [Golem](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Golems): **HD** 9 (40 hp); **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 2 slams (2d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 6; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 10/1400; **Special**: Alarm, immunity to cold and electricity, double damage from fire

### Gorbel

This bizarre creature is a small orb with reddish skin. Atop its round body are six eyestalks, each ending in a sapphire-colored eye. Dangling beneath its body are two stubby legs that end in claws. A gorbel is approximately 3 feet in diameter. Its reddish skin is a thin, tough and rubbery membrane. The spherical body of a gorbel is highly elastic and filled to near bursting with a lighter-than air flammable gas that smells of rotten eggs (sulfur). A gorbel eats, breathes, and excretes through an aperture best described as a mouth. This mouth is lined with a ring of sharp teeth that face inward to help it force food into its gullet.

A gorbel’s body is naturally buoyant. This buoyancy allows it to fly at a speed of 60 feet and also grants it a permanent *feather fall* effect.

When a gorbel is hit with a weapon, spell, or effect that deals piercing or slashing damage it must succeed on a saving throw or explode, dealing 1d4 points of damage to all creatures within 5 feet. This instantly kills the gorbel.

- Gorbel: **HD** 2; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d4), bite (1d5); **Move** 3/24 (flying); **Save** 16; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**: Explosion, cannot be surprised, only harmed by sharp weapons.

### Gorgimera

A gorgimera is a chimerical creature akin to the standard chimera. A gorgimera has the heads of a lion, dragon, and gorgon. A gorgimera’s dragon head can be that of any of the chaotic dragons (see below). It has the hindquarters of a gorgon and the forequarters of lion. It is a highly territorial predator whose hunting range often covers several square miles around its lair. The creature makes its home inside caves high atop mountains or deep inside caverns. A typical lair contains a mated pair and one or two young.

A gorgimera has two breath weapons, each of which can be used independently of the other (thus it can breathe twice in a given round as a standard action). A gorgimera’s dragon head breath weapon depends on the color of its dragon head, as summarized on the table below. Regardless of its type, a gorgimera’s breath weapon is usable once every 1d4 rounds, deals 3d8 points of damage and allows a saving throw for half damage. To determine a gorgimera’s head color and breath weapon randomly, roll 1d10 and consult the table below.

**d10 Head**
1-2 Black Dragon Head 40-foot line of acid for breath weapon
3-4 Blue Dragon Head 40-foot line of lightning for breath weapon
5-6 Green Dragon Head 20-foot cone of corrosive gas for breath weapon
7-8 Red Dragon Head 20-foot cone of fire for breath weapon
9-10 White Dragon Head 20-foot cone of cold for breath weapon

A gorgimera’s gorgon head breath weapon is usable once every 1d4 rounds (no more than twice per day), turns a creature to stone permanently, and allows a saving throw to avoid. The breath weapon is a cone 30 feet long and 20 feet wide at the base.

- Gorgimera: **HD** 10; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 2 bites (1d10), butt (1d8), 2 claws (1d6); **Move** 15/18 (flying); **Save** 5; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 13/2300; **Special**: breath weapon.

### Gorgon

Gorgons are bull-like creatures with [dragon](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Dragons)-like scales. Their breath turns people to stone (60 ft. range, saving throw applies).

- Gorgon: **HD** 8; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 1 gore (2d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 8; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 10/1400; **Special**: Breath turns to stone.

### Gorgon, True

Though the word gorgon is often associated with the deadly bull-like creature that turns a victim to stone with its breath weapon, the true gorgons are three sisters; Euryale, Sthenno, and Medusa. They are the daughters of the god Phorcys and the goddess Ceto. Euryale and Sthenno were born immortal and are hideous creatures with writing snakes for hair, brass claws, wings, and a gaze that can turn any living creature into stone. Phorcys tasked them with guarding the entrance to the Underworld.

Medusa was born mortal and was very beautiful. Phorcys sent her to the Material Plane so all could gaze upon the beauty of his daughter. Medusa’s beauty rivaled that of some of the goddesses, and some of them grew jealous of Medusa, particularly the goddess Athena. Her beauty also turned the heads of some of the gods, and when Poseidon seduced her in a temple to Athena, the goddess became enraged and changed the beautiful Medusa into a creature as hideous as her sisters. Poseidon turned from his love, never to return again. Medusa, enraged, fled into the desert and never came back to civilization.

The hero Perseus was tasked with killing the gorgon known as Medusa and bringing her head to King Polydectes as a wedding present. Using a magic shield given to him by the gods, he avoided Medusa’s deadly gaze and severed her head. From her serpentine body sprang the children of Poseidon, creatures similar in appearance to their mother. These creatures escaped into the world and are called medusa.

Sthenno and Euryale long for their sister’s return or their meeting with her in the Underworld. Yet being immortal, they cannot enter the Realm of the Dead. Thus, both know they will never see their beloved sibling again. Their cries are said to be audible on the wind as a high-pitched shrill akin to a bird’s cry.

The sisters’ gaze turns people to stone permanently. The poisonous bites of their snakes are deadly (i.e. pass a saving throw or die).

Sthenno and Euryale are immune to polymorph, sleep, stunning and paralysis.

- Sthenno: **HD** 18 (75 hp); **AC** -1 \[20\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d10), bite (1d8), snakes (1d6 plus poison); **Move** 12/21(flying); **Save** 3; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 26/6200; **Special**: Petrifying gaze, poison, +2 or better weapon to hit, regenerate (2 hp/rd), immortal, immunities, magic resistance (60%)
- Euryale: **HD** 20 (80 hp); **AC** -2 \[21\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d10), bite (1d8), snakes (1d6 plus poison); **Move** 12/21(flying); **Save** 3; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 28/6800; **Special**: Petrifying gaze, poison, +2 or better weapon to hit, regenerate (2 hp/rd), immortal, immunities, magic resistance (65%)

### Gorilla Bear

Gorilla bears are the result of a magical crossbreeding and merging of two distinct species: a gorilla and a black bear. A gorilla bear’s fur is always dark and ranges in color from jet black to brownish-black. Its paws and feet end in elongated nails, brown in color. A typical gorilla bear stands 8 feet tall and weighs almost 1,700 pounds. Its eyes are always one of two colors: crimson or emerald green. No other eye color has ever been seen on a gorilla bear (though legends speak of an immensely powerful white-furred gorilla bear with eyes the color of amethysts). Gorilla bears make their lairs in caves or caverns, often hidden among the twisted tangle of trees and shrubs of jungles. They are diurnal hunters and feast on a diet of meat, savoring the taste of goblins and elves. A typical lair contains a mated pair and 1d4 young. A gorilla bear that hits a victim with both claw attacks squeezes them for 1d8+1 points of damage.

- Gorilla Bear: **HD** 4; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d8), bite (1d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 12; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: Squeeze.

### Grave Risen

Grave risen are rotting, worm-ridden, walking corpses draped in tattered and loosely fitting rags or outfitted in dented and rusted armor. Blackened eye sockets grant it sight and its body still clings to the stench of death. The clawed hands of a grave risen are filthy; its nails long and caked with dirt and soil from its grave. Once per day, a grave risen can animate up to 10 HD of corpses within 100 feet as zombies. A grave risen’s claws are coated with a deadly poison that infects the blood.

- Grave Risen: **HD** 4; **AC** 8 \[11\] 7 \[12\] with shield; **Atk** 2 claws (1d4+2 + blood poisoning); **Move** 6; **Save** 13; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Animate dead, blood poisoning.

### Gravebird

Gravebirds are highly intelligent undead birds (usually ravens or crows) that have been brought back to life through foul magic. Any creature wounded by a Gravebird must make a successful saving throw or contract Grave Fever, a disease similar to Mummy Rot, which prevents magical healing and causes wounds to heal at one-tenth of the normal rate. A cure disease spell will remove the fever. Gravebirds can Speak with the Dead (as per the spell) three times daily. (*Author: Andrew Trent)*

- Gravebird: **HD** 2; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d4) or 2 claws (1d3); **Move** 4 (Fly 16); **Save** 16; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 3/120; **Special**: Disease upon successful hit (save applies), Speak with the Dead.

### Gray Nisp

Gray nisps resemble hairless humanoids with smooth, slick skin; their hands and feet are webbed and end in claws, and their faces have large, dark pupiless eyes. They have no noses or ears, and its small fishlike mouth is filled with tiny, sharp teeth. Gray nisps are 9 feet tall, with light gray skin and a white underbelly, and weighs well over 300 pounds. If a gray nisp hits with both claws, it rends for an additional 2d6 points of damage. A gray nisp cannot survive on dry land.

- Gray Nisp: **HD** 8; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d6), bite (1d8); **Move** 6/18 (swim); **Save** 8; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: Rend

### Graymalkins

Graymalkins are magical creatures that resemble ordinary cats. To the casual observer, a graymalkin appear to be nothing more than a raggedy-looking cat with nothing unusual about it. This disguise aids the graymalkin in its travels, allowing it to move unmolested among living creatures.

Graymalkins always dwell near populated areas, preferring cities to towns, towns to villages, and so on. They often choose an owner (a living creature they deem gullible and easily manipulated) and convince that creature to take them home with them (by using their fascination ability). Once inside their owner’s house, a graymalkin uses its special abilities to kill its owner and any other family members. Such attacks usually occur at night (in the case of the slinker) or over a period of time (in the case of the tether).

Graymalkins are often found serving as the familiar to an evil spellcaster or hag. They prefer females to males when serving as a familiar and very rarely do they ever use their special abilities against their true owner. (Some tales say that when a graymalkin is serving as a familiar, its master is actually immune to its special abilities.)

Graymalkins avoid direct confrontations with opponents, preferring to attack helpless or otherwise unobservant foes. If forced into battle, a graymalkin seeks escape as quick as possible.

#### Common Graymalkin

Graymalkins are magical creatures that resemble ordinary cats. A graymalkin can attempt to charm a single opponent. The target can make a successful save to resist the attempt. Graymalkins are magical creatures that resemble ordinary cats. They appear to be nothing more than a raggedy-looking cat with nothing unusual about it. This disguise aids the graymalkin in its travels, allowing it to move unmolested among living creatures. A graymalkin can fascinate a single opponent (save resists). A creature that fails its save “adopts” the graymalkin as a pet, clinging to the cat and always keeping it close by. The effect is similar to a *charm person* spell. Once inside their owner’s house, a graymalkin kills its owner and any family members.

- Common Graymalkin: **HD** 1d4 hit points; **AC** 9 \[10\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1 point of damage); **Move** 10; **Save** 18; **AL** C; **CL/XP** A/5; **Special**: charm.

#### Slinker Graymalkin

A slinker is referred to in legend as a witch cat, hell cat, or demonic cat that creeps into a family’s house and steals the breath from their sleeping children. It appears as a large graymalkin. A slinker can fascinate a single opponent (save resists). A creature that fails its save “adopts” the slinker as a pet, clinging to the cat and always keeping it close by. The effect is similar to a *charm person* spell. Once inside their owner’s house, a slinker kills its owner and any family members at night by sucking the air from their lungs as they sleep (save resists). If the save fails, the victim loses a quarter of its hit points. A successful save means the victim awakens, although it is still charmed.

- Slinker Graymalkin: **HD** 1; **AC** 9 \[10\]; **Atk** 2 claws, 1 bite (1 point of damage each); **Move** 10; **Save** 17; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 1/15; **Special**: breath stealing, fascination.

### Great Lantern Worm

Great Lantern Worms are huge megadriles that grow 100ft or more in length, exceeding ten feet in width. They are subterranean, chewing tunnels in rock before swelling to fit the tunnel. Almost their entire length is taken up by the empty stomach, with their organs on the exterior, covered by a tough membrane of earthen hue. At the rear of the worm’s long gut is a photophore, a light-emitting organ used as a lure for prey. Once the prey has travelled halfway down the stomach, the worm’s mouth will close and acid will be sprayed from various points along the gut wall, requiring a saving throw each round to dodge. Should the entrapped prey try to cut their way out, any weapon that succeeds in hitting the stomach wall has a chance of dissolving. The chance for a non-magic weapon to dissolve is 1 in 8, and for a magic weapon the chance is 1 in 12. Each time a weapon avoids being dissolved, +1 is added to the chance of dissolving upon the next hit. For example, if a magic weapon hits and is not dissolved, the chance of dissolving on the second hit is 2 in 12 rather than 1 in 12. If a victim manages to stay alive long enough to return to the mouth, he can attempt to force it open (1 in 6 chance to succeed, +1 per helper). Victims are digested within hours. (*Author: Sean Wills)*

- Great Lantern Worm: **HD** 30; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** Acid spray (3d4) **Move** 6; **Save** 3; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 30/8400 ; **Special**: acid spray, swallow whole.

### Green Brain

Green brains are plant-creatures grown by the Shrooms (and possibly by other malevolent races with aptitudes for magically altering and breeding plants). Green brains are relatively intelligent, and are generally used to supervise and oversee the activities of mindless or semi-intelligent creatures using their powers of mental communication. In general, the supervised species will be plant-creatures of some kind, but it is possible for a green brain to act somewhat less effectively as the overseer for brutish humanoids or other non-plant creatures.

Green brains are able to project mental commands and communications at a deep enough level that the brain’s demands are clear even to mindless creatures such as oozes or monstrous plants. Indeed, the less intelligent the recipient of the orders, the stronger the green brain’s hold over it.

In addition to telepathic communication, a green brain can use its mental powers as a weapon when necessary. A green brain is able to continuously project a cone of mental force 50ft long and widening to 30ft at the end, which has the following effects: (1) any spells being cast are disrupted, although they are not lost from the caster’s memory, (2) anyone failing a saving throw within the cone becomes somewhat disoriented, making attacks at a penalty of -2 (duration 1d3 rounds) and having a 1 in 6 chance to drop any item held in the hands. The green brain may also narrow its mental focus to project a beam of concentrated, damaging thought, inflicting 2d6 points of damage to any single individual who fails a saving throw. (*Author: Matt Finch)*

- Green Brain: **HD** 5; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** None; **Move** (Fly 15); **Save** 12; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 6/4400 ; **Special**: Mental attacks.

### Green Slime

Green slime isn’t technically a monster, just an extremely dangerous hazard in underground tombs and other such places. Any metal or organic substance it touches begins to turn to green slime (saving throw). It can be killed with fire or extreme cold, and the transformation process can be arrested by the use of a *cure disease* spell.

### Gremlin

Gremlins are wicked faerie folk who revel in destruction and mayhem. They resemble a goblin with long floppy ears, pinched wrinkled faces, nasty claws, a mouth full of sharp teeth and a wicked glint to its eyes. A gremlin stands 3-1/2 feet tall and weighs about 40 pounds. Bright light blinds gremlins for 1 turn. They do an additional 1d6 points of damage to surprised opponents. Gremlins can turn *invisible* at will.

- Gremlin: **HD** 1d6 hit points; **AC** 9 \[10\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d2), 1 bite (1d2) or 1 weapon (1d4); **Move** 10; **Save** 18; **AL** C; **CL/XP** B/10; **Special**: Magic resistance (15%), +1 magic weapon needed to hit, *invisible*

### Grey Ooze

Grey ooze is almost identical in appearance to wet rock, but it is a slimy, formless substance that devours prey and carrion with its acidic secretions, lashing out to strike enemies. Grey ooze is immune to spells, heat, and cold damage. Metal (but not stone or wood) must make a saving throw vs. acid when exposed to grey ooze (even if the contact is as brief as the strike of a sword) or be rotted through. When the grey ooze hits a character in metal armor, the armor must make an item saving throw. Only cutting and piercing damages a grey ooze—it is impervious to blunt or crushing attacks.

- Grey Ooze: **HD** 3; **AC** 8 \[11\]; **Atk** 1 strike (2d6); **Move** 1; **Save** 14; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Acid, immune to spells, heat, cold, and blunt weapons.

### Grick

Gricks resemble massive, human-sized worms with 4 tentacles surrounding a beaked mouth. They rear up to attack, focusing on one opponent at a time. They do not immediately try to feed on dying prey, but if given the chance they will drag unconscious or dead bodies into their lairs to feed. Blunt weapons do not harm them, due to their thick hides and resilient flesh.

- Grick: **HD** 2; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 4 tentacles (1d3), 1 beak (1d2); **Move** 6; **Save** 16; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: Immune to blunt weapons.

### Griffon

Griffons have the body of a lion, with the head, fore-claws, and wings of an eagle. These creatures can be tamed and ridden as mounts. They usually nest in high mountain aeries, where they lay their eggs and hunt their prey. Because the fledglings can be tamed, young griffons and griffon eggs command a very high price in the marketplaces of the great cities, or to noble lords and wizards.

- Griffon: **HD** 7; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d4), 1 bite (2d8); **Move** 12 (Fly 27); **Save** 9; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: None.

### Grimm

This monstrous beast stands well over 9 feet tall and has glistening black flesh. Its head is oval with deep sunken black eyes. Its mouth is wide and large and sports double rows of razor-sharp fangs. A purplish-black tongue flicks in and out of its mouth. The monster’s powerful arms and legs end in filthy wicked claws that sport broken, black fingernails. A grimm stands 9 feet tall and weighs more than 1,200 pounds. A grimm drains life from Lawful creatures, dealing 1d6 points of damage each round.

- Grimm: **HD** 12; **AC** 0 \[19\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d8), 1 bite (2d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 3; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 13/2300; **Special**: Magic resistance (35%), +1 magic weapons or better needed to hit, death aura

### Grimstalker (Banaan)

The grimstalker is a fey creature that does not share the beauty and goodness of its kin. They are hairless humanoid fey, slender and graceful, with long arms and legs. The grimstalker’s skin is brown and woody, almost having the texture and hardness of tree bark, and their hands are tipped in sharp claws that drip toxic venom with the consistency of pinesap. They often decorate themselves with leaves and vines that actually take root in their skin and cover them with a protective layer as thick as leather armor. Grimstalkers deliver a paralytic poison with each claw attack that stuns victims for 1d4+1 rounds. Grimstalkers can cast *plant growth* and *warp wood* three times per day.

- Grimstalker: **HD** 6; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d4+1 + poison) or 1 weapon (1d6+1); **Move** 6/3 (climbing); **Save** 11; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 7/600; **Special**: Poison, spell-like abilities

### Grippli

Gripplis are short, bipedal tree frogs that dwell in swamps and marshes. They can move upright or on all fours. A grippli stands 2 to 2-1/2 feet tall and weighs from 40 to 50 pounds. Its eyes are yellow with vertical-slit pupils of black. Gripplis often wear brightly colored or decorated clothes. They are attracted to and love brightly colored items. Gripplis speak their own language and some speak common or elven. Gripplis can move across marshlands, swamps, and mud without any penalty to their movement.

Grippli characters can take levels in fighter (up to 5th level) or thief (up to 7th level). They can see in the dark as well as elves and enjoy a +5% bonus to climb walls (maximum 99%).

- Grippli: **HD** 1; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** Weapon (1d4); **Move** 12/12 (climbing); **Save** 17 **AL** N; **CL/XP** 1/15; **Special**: Marsh move.

### Groaning Spirit

The groaning spirit is the malevolent spirit of a female elf that is found haunting swamps, fens, moors, and other desolate places. Groaning spirits hate the living and seek to destroy whomever they meet. A groaning spirit appears as a translucent image of her former self.

Anyone viewing a groaning spirit must succeed on a saving throw or flee in terror for 1d6+4 rounds. Damage caused by the groaning spirit’s touch attack sends a chilling cold through an opponent’s body. Any creature touched must succeed on a saving throw or suffer 1 point of Strength drain. Groaning spirits are the bane of other undead, and any undead they touch (except other groaning spirits) must succeed on a saving throw or flee in fear for 2d6 rounds.

Once per day, at night only, a groaning spirit can release a death wail audible to a range of 1 mile. All creatures within 30 feet of the groaning spirit must make a successful saving throw or die. Those that make their save still take 3d6 points of damage.

If a spellcaster uses *holy word* against a groaning spirit, the creature must succeed on a saving throw or die immediately.

- Groaning Spirit: **HD** 7; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** Incorporeal touch (1d8 + chill touch); **Move** 12; **Save** 9; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 12/2000; **Special**: Chill touch, fear aura, keening, immunity to cold and electricity, magic resistance (50%), unnatural aura, vulnerability

### Gronk

Gronks are the typical big, dumb brutes; a male gronk is on average approximately 9 feet tall, with females only slightly smaller. Gronks have mottled gray skin and shaggy brown hair that is thickest at its head and shoulders and gradually thins out around its waist. The arms and legs of a gronk are massive, like tree limbs attached to its thick barrel-like torso. The face of a gronk seems almost lost amid the long hair hanging from its head. The most notable feature of a gronk’s face is the long, rhinoceros-like horn between its eyes.

- Gronk: **HD** 5; **AC** 8 \[11\]; **Atk** 2 slams (1d6) and horn (1d8), or 1 weapon (1d8) and horn (1d8); **Move** 12; **Save** 12; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: None

### Growling Shadow

Growling shadows are spirit creatures that inhabit darkness and shadow, usually underground but in some cases in dark forests as well. Their presence will immediately be noticed, for they make growling sounds that seem to come from several directions at one time. A growling shadow materializes and vanishes from place to place when attacking, selecting a single victim at a time. Each round, the shadow will appear in front of a randomly determined opponent and attack, disappearing again so swiftly that *only the one character being attacked* has the opportunity to strike back. The shadow’s attack automatically deals one hit point of damage without the need to make a to-hit roll; if it is not killed before it has inflicted 10 hit points it will retreat, sated, back into the shadows whence it came. (*Author: Matt Finch)*

- Growling Shadow: **HD** 2; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1 hp, automatic); **Move** 12; **Save** 16; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: Automatic damage, vanishing.

### Grue (1)

A grue is a nasty, large thing with dark grey or green skin, rather like a half-filled water balloon ten feet long, with a huge mouth. Inside its leathery skin, the grue is mostly gelatinous. Grues cannot coexist with light; if they are exposed to a light source, they instantly recede with the darkness. In the dark, however, they are dangerous. If a grue hits with a natural roll of 20 on its attack die, it swallows the victim whole; which will satisfy the grue, and it will leave if it is permitted to do so (the swallowed victim will suffocate in 2d4 rounds and then be digested). They are non-intelligent, and are immune to blunt and piercing weapons (e.g., clubs, maces, arrows, spears). Swords, axes, and other cutting weapons inflict normal damage. Grues can magically extinguish one normal light source per round at a distance of 100ft. (*Author: Matt Finch)*

- Grue: **HD** 9; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 1 bite (2d6); **Move** 9; **Save** 6; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 12/2000; **Special**: immune to blunt and piercing weapons, extinguish normal lights, swallow whole.

### Grue (2)

Found in the darkest recesses of dungeons or in the deepest corners of attics, grues are the essence of Chaos and Darkness given form by evil and a ravenous appetite for living souls. Grues have no specific shape or form, save for the ravening, slavering jaws that close around the unsuspecting, or those who would venture into the darkness without a torch or match in their inventory. Grues are chaotic spirits that exist in a 10ft x 10ft area of pure darkness. Any light source brought into that same area forces the grue to flee to the nearest dark area. Any creature within the area of darkness is subject to attack by the grue’s jaws. For all intents and purposes, grues are invisible to anyone within the area of darkness, but outside of the area, a grue looks like “living darkness.” Grues are only affected by magical weapons or weapons that emit light of some kind, including a torch (which would act like a club). They are resistant to all spell attacks, save those that have some sort of light component (a light spell, prismatic spray or even fireball). Grues can magically extinguish one normal light source per round at a distance of 100ft. A grue’s attack will replenish its hit points with any hit points “eaten” from its victims. A grue cannot replenish beyond its starting hit points. Anyone killed by a grue will vanish, including all of his equipment. In 1d4 days, he will become a grue. (*Author: Chgowiz)*

- Grue: **HD** 6; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 1 bite (2d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 11; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 11/1700; **Special**: immune to all but light/magic weapons and spells with light component/effect, can extinguish lights w/in 100ft, restores own HP with damage caused to victims.

### Gryph

Gronks are the typical big, dumb brutes; a male gronk is on average approximately 9 feet tall, with females only slightly smaller. Gronks have mottled gray skin and shaggy brown hair that is thickest at its head and shoulders and gradually thins out around its waist. The arms and legs of a gronk are massive, like tree limbs attached to its thick barrel-like torso. The face of a gronk seems almost lost amid the long hair hanging from its head. The most notable feature of a gronk’s face is the long, rhinoceros-like horn between its eyes.

- Gryph: **HD** 2; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** Touch (attach) or beak (1d8); **Move** 3/21 (flying); **Save** 16; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Attach, implant eggs.

### Gump

Gumps are large and blubbery humanoids with an overly broad jagged toothed grin and a pair of small, deep-set eyes in an otherwise featureless face. Gumps are motivated by hunger and the deep down joy they feel when murdering a helpless foe. Anyone meeting the gaze of a gump must save vs. paralysis at +2 or be held in place for 2-5 rounds (fighting without looking incurs a -4 penalty to-hit). It is safe to view a gump’s reflection in a mirror or other reflective surface. The gump is able to squint in an odd manner which keeps it from paralyzing an ally. (*Author: JD Jarvis)*

- Gump: **HD** 4; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 1 weapon (1d6+2); **Move** 9; **Save** 13; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Gaze attack paralyzes (+2 save).

### Gutslug

A gutslug is a slimy, sticky worm that resembles entrails. The body is a lumpy, veined, gray tube approximately 10 feet long but usually no thicker than an inch in diameter. Gutslugs have no eyes, and their mouth is large, round, and resembles the suckered mouth of a leech. A gutslug latches onto a victim with a successful bite, automatically draining blood for 1d4 points of damage each round until it drains a total of 8 hit points or is removed.

- Gutslug: **HD** 2; **AC** 8 \[11\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d4 + blood drain); **Move** 6/12 (flying); **Save** 16; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 2/30; **Special**: Blood rain.

### Gwurrum

An eerie green mist seeps through the trees at twilight, stealing up to the houses of those who have failed to leave an offering to the faerie folk of the woods. It is the gwurrum, monstrous servant of the faerie court, come to pay a visit.

The gwurrum is composed of equal parts choking mist and thirst for blood. It can force its way through the tiniest cracks in any barrier, crawl uphill, and pour down chimneys and throats like cold water. The misty body is roughly 10 ft. in diameter, and its trailing tendrils can reach up to 10ft from its form. Any and all targets within range will be attacked, though if free to choose, the faerie monster will focus upon children and small animals: those whose loss will cause the greatest sorrow and misery in the punished community. Dim-witted and malicious, it can be distracted by offerings of whiskey, recitations of poetry extolling the virtues of the faerie-folk, and the singing of an unbroken voice. Iron objects cause an additional 1d6 points of damage to the gwurrum (the mere touch of iron causes 1d6 points), but these items will turn to dust within 1 round after contact with the gwurrum. The faerie monster is otherwise immune to fire, electrical, poison, or mind-affecting attacks. Any creature with magical singing abilities, such as a harpy or bard, can keep a gwurrum at bay for 1 round per hit dice or level. A gwurrum is affected by Protection from Evil, and cannot attack anyone who is thoroughly drunk.

In the morning, when a gwurrum departs, dead leaves will be found scattered around the dwelling of anyone it attacked. Children who survive the attack of a gwurrum may, upon growing up, pass freely into the faerie realms. (*Author: Scott Wylie Roberts, “Myrystyr”)*

- Gwurrum: **HD** 9; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 1 per target in 10 ft. reach (1d8/round); **Move** 6; **Save** 6; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 12/2000; **Special**: immunities.

### Hags

#### Annis Hag

Annis Hags are giantesses, horrid looking females as large as ogres. They lust for human flesh to eat, and often polymorph themselves into human form to hunt (an old lady being a common shape), or to lure their prey from places of safety. Strong as a bear, the annis can attack in similar fashion; if she hits with both claws, the victim is held and the annis inflicts automatic damage with all three attacks thereafter. The victim isn’t helpless, but cannot break free unless he is as strong as a giant. Annis are somewhat magical; they can summon mists to hide themselves and their rank lairs; some are also witches with the ability to cast spells (such being left to the Referee’s determination, if witch-hags are to be encountered).

- Annis: **HD** 8; **AC** 1 \[18\]; **Atk** 2 claws (2d8), 1 bite (1d8); **Move** 12; **Save** 8; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 10/1400; **Special**: Hug and rend, polymorph, call mists.

#### Mountain Hag (Yama-Uba)

The mountain hags (“Yama-uba” in Asian-type settings) are solitary, horrid looking blue-skinned females as large as ogres. They live in mountainous regions and near passes where they can hunt for food. Mountain hags feast on all manner of flesh; but they prefer humans, attacking with their long claws and wicked mouths that stretch from ear to ear. (*Author: Mike Davison)*

- Mountain Hag/Yama-uba: **HD** 7; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d6), 1 bite (1d8); **Move** 12; **Save** 9; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 7/600; **Special**: None.

#### Sea Hag

The sea hag is a giantess much like the annis, but living in the seas, or in fetid, salt-water marshes. These hags are so hideous that the sight of their faces causes weakness from fright and horror; if the victim fails a saving throw, his strength ability score is reduced by one-half for 1d6 full turns. The hag can also cast an evil eye upon those she chooses to slay; but only three times per day. The range of this deadly gaze is 30ft, and the hag’s eye need not be met in order for death to occur (saving throw). Like the annis, sea hags feast with gusto upon human flesh.

- Sea Hag: **HD** 3; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d4); **Move** 6 (Swim 18); **Save** 14; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Death gaze, weakness gaze.

### Half-Ogre

Half-ogres are rare crossbreeds of human and ogre. Standing a few feet shorter than their ogre kin and a few feet taller than their human kin, half-ogres have strength as well as speed and intelligence (relative to other ogres) in their favor. Their skin and hair color generally match that of their ogre parent, with dark tones such as gray, brown, or olive being the most prevalent. Half-ogres speak the common tongue, and those with an intelligence score of at least 10 also speak ogre.

Half-ogres, though generally outcasts among humans and feared for their ugliness and size, can find some acceptance among ogres. Half-ogres in an ogre band need to prove themselves constantly to their larger kin, however. For this reason, half-ogres found among an ogre band are cruel, violent, and strong; weaker half-ogres usually wind up in the stew pot. Most half-ogres found among full-blooded ogres are leaders of the ogre band or are at least well on their way to becoming leaders. Their long years suffering the harsh treatment of their kin help half-ogres develop a sense of cunning and a strong will to survive. Therefore, ogres under the leadership of a half-ogre fight more effectively, even engaging in planned ambushes and complicated tactics that are beyond most ogres.

On rare occasions, half-ogres collect into hybrid communities of other half-ogre races (such as orogs and ogrillons) or humanoids (such as orcs and half-orcs). These rogue bands of outcasts form bandit clans or marauding groups that are the bane of other humanoid communities in their area.

#### Half-Ogres as Characters

Half-ogre leaders tend to be barbaric fighters and can advance to the 6th level of ability (7th level if their strength score is 13 or higher). Half-ogre clerics worship “the Destroyer” and can advance to the 4th level of ability (5th level if their wisdom is 15 or higher). Half-ogres can also multi-class as fighter/clerics, reaching a maximum of 5th level as fighters and 3rd level as clerics.

Half-Ogre enjoy a +1 bonus to strength and constitution and a -1 penalty to intelligence and charisma at character creation. These modifications cannot take an ability score over 18 or below 3.

Half-ogres begin their careers with one additional hit dice (1d6).

Half-ogres can see in darkness as well as a dwarf.

- Half-Ogre: **HD** 2; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** Two-handed sword (2d6+1) or spear (1d6+1); **Move** 16; **Save** 16; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 2/30; **Special**: None

### Hamster, Giant

Giant hamsters are larger, more aggressive relatives of the normal hamster. Like their smaller cousins, they come in a variety of colors, shapes, and sizes. Giant hamsters are omnivorous, but prefer to feast on a diet of grains, berries, nuts, and water. On occasion, they indulge in and eat meat, usually insects and the like. Also like its smaller cousin, the giant hamster can store food in its cheek pouches. The average giant hamster can store about 200 pounds of food at any given time. Giant hamsters normally shun combat, but if cornered or extremely hungry they may attack. Note that even domesticated giant hamsters attack if their young are threatened. The giant hamster attacks by biting with its long, sharp teeth. A giant hamster can try to stuff a grabbed opponent of dwarf size or smaller into its cheek pouch by making a successful bite attack. The victim gets a saving throw to avoid being grabbed. A creature stuffed into the giant hamster’s cheek pouch takes no damage, and can escape by making a successful open doors check or can cut its way out by using a light slashing or piercing weapon to deal 10 points of damage to the cheek (AC 8 \[11\]). A giant hamster’s cheek can hold 1 dwarf or halfling.

- Giant Hamster: **HD** 4; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d8); **Move** 9/6 (burrowing); **Save** 13; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Cheek pouch, grab, immunity to disease

### Hanged Man

A hanged man appears much as it did in life, though its skin is pale and pulled tight over its bones. Its head hangs at an odd angle, unsupported by its shattered neck bones. A rotted noose and several feet of rope hang from its neck and trail off behind it as it walks. Its eyes have no pupils. A hanged man can only utter choked gurgles, gasps and strangled moans. It uses the rope that killed it to snare victims and drag them into the hanged man’s waiting claws. The rope can be cast up to 20 feet away, and wraps around creatures with a successful hit.

- Hanged Man: **HD** 3; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d4); **Move** 6; **Save** 14; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**: Hangman's rope

### Hangman Tree

Hangman trees look like nothing more than giant oak trees. Close inspection reveals a scar-like marking on the lower part of the trunk (this is where undigested creatures or gear is expelled after digestion). Hidden among the hangman tree’s branches and leaves are its rope-like appendages that it uses to trap its prey. Hangman trees can speak broken Common. The hangman tree attacks by dropping its noose-like appendages around prey and yanking victims upwards. Trapped prey is held until it dies or is dropped into the hangman’s trunk where it is digested. Hangman trees have no visual organs but can ascertain all foes within 60 feet using sound, scent, and vibration.

Opponents struck by a vine in combat must pass a saving throw or be strangled for 1d6+1 points of damage per round until the vine is cut (it has an AC of 4 \[15\] and can take 6 hp damage) or the strangled victim or a rescuer makes a successful open doors check. The hangman tree can attempt to swallow a strangling (or strangled) victim with a successful attack roll and a failed saving throw by the target. A swallowed victim suffers 2d6 points of crushing damage per round and can only escape with a successful open doors check. The tree’s trunk can hold up to two human-sized victims.

Besides the danger of its vines and trunk, a hangman tree can also release a cloud of spores in a 50-foot radius spread. Creatures in the area must succeed on a saving throw or believe the tree to be of some ordinary sort or to be a treant or other such friendly tree creature. An affected creature becomes passive for 2d6 rounds and refuses to attack the hangman tree during this time.

A hangman tree takes half again as much (+50%) damage as normal from electricity, regardless of whether a saving throw is allowed, or if the save is a success or failure. Cold-based effects paralyze a hangman tree as if by a *hold monster* spell. Spells that generate darkness slow  the hangman tree (as the *slow* spell) for 1 round per caster level.

- Hangman Tree: **HD** 8; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 4 vines (1d8); **Move** 3; **Save** 8; **AL** N (with chaotic tendencies); **CL/XP** 10/1400; **Special**: Hallucinatory spores, magic resistance (45%), strangle, swallow, surprise on 1-4 on 1d6

### Harpy

Harpies have the upper body of a human female and the lower body and wings of a vulture. Their song is a charm that draws its victims to the harpy (saving throw applies), and the harpy’s touch casts the equivalent of a charm person spell (again, saving throw applies).

- Harpy: **HD** 3; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 2 talons (1d3) and weapon (1d6); **Move** 6 (Fly 18); **Save** 14; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: Flight, siren-song.

### Haunt

Hangman trees look like nothing more than giant oak trees. Close inspection reveals a scar-like marking on the lower part of the trunk (this is where undigested creatures or gear is expelled after digestion). Hidden among the hangman tree’s branches and leaves are its rope-like appendages that it uses to trap its prey. Hangman trees can speak broken Common. The hangman tree attacks by dropping its noose-like appendages around prey and yanking victims upwards. Trapped prey is held until it dies or is dropped into the hangman’s trunk where it is digested. Hangman trees have no visual organs but can ascertain all foes within 60 feet using sound, scent, and vibration.

Opponents struck by a vine in combat must pass a saving throw or be strangled for 1d6+1 points of damage per round until the vine is cut (it has an AC of 4 \[15\] and can take 6 hp damage) or the strangled victim or a rescuer makes a successful open doors check. The hangman tree can attempt to swallow a strangling (or strangled) victim with a successful attack roll and a failed saving throw by the target. A swallowed victim suffers 2d6 points of crushing damage per round and can only escape with a successful open doors check. The tree’s trunk can hold up to two human-sized victims.

Besides the danger of its vines and trunk, a hangman tree can also release a cloud of spores in a 50-foot radius spread. Creatures in the area must succeed on a saving throw or believe the tree to be of some ordinary sort or to be a treant or other such friendly tree creature. An affected creature becomes passive for 2d6 rounds and refuses to attack the hangman tree during this time.

A hangman tree takes half again as much (+50%) damage as normal from electricity, regardless of whether a saving throw is allowed, or if the save is a success or failure. Cold-based effects paralyze a hangman tree as if by a *hold monster* spell. Spells that generate darkness slow  the hangman tree (as the *slow* spell) for 1 round per caster level.

- Haunt: **HD** 5; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** Ghostly touch (1d4 plus 1d3 dexterity); **Move** 9/12 (flying); **Save** 12; **AL** Any (usually chaotic); **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: Alternate form, dexterity damage, immune to turning, malevolence, rejuvenation, strangle, vulnerabilities

### Hawktoad

Hawktoads are levitating amphibians with the body of a very large toad but with long, clawed front legs and no back legs at all. The hind end of a hawktoad is a foot-long tail, like that of a tadpole; the full length of a hawktoad is three feet. These bizarre creatures move by lashing through the air with their tadpole-like tails, and attack by swooping in at opponents, scratching with their tiny claws and lashing out with their long tongues. A hawktoad’s tongue does no damage, but if the attack succeeds the tongue has whipped around the character’s neck. If this happens, the hawktoad lands at the back of the victim’s neck; it holds tight with its tiny claws and begins to strangle the opponent, using its muscular tongue as a garrotte. When a hawktoad is attached in this way, the strangling character will find it difficult to reach around and attack, of course.

Each round thereafter, the character must successfully roll a d20 under his constitution score or fall unconscious; each round a cumulative +1 is added to the d20 roll, making it harder and harder to avoid passing out. Once the character passes out, the toad strangles him to death in three rounds. (*Author: Matt Finch)*

- Hawktoad: **HD** 2; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d2), tongue (strangles); **Move** 3 (Fly 12); **Save** 16; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**: Strangling tongue.

### Head-Stealer

A head-stealer is the headless, undead body of someone who has been decapitated, usually by execution or dungeon trap. The body is animated with a vengeful spirit, and seeks to re-enter society by removing someone else’s head and placing it atop its own neck. Although the head-stealer’s body remains in a relatively preserved state, its stolen heads continue to decay, and the head-stealer seeks to replace them on a regular basis. Although the head-stealer can animate its substitute heads, the unnatural grafting of dead flesh to undead flesh is highly imperfect. The head does not attach by magic, so the head-stealer is required to use a measure such as rope or nails to affix the new head. Moreover, the head stealer can only imprecisely animate a stolen head, and while it can cause speech to issue forth, the slurring and twitching will tend to raise suspicion. As with all undead creatures, the head stealer is immune to mind-affecting spells and vulnerable to holy water. The head stealer can be immediately destroyed by attaching the head it formerly possessed in life, if the head still exists. Any attack against the head stealer may dislodge the stolen head on a natural roll of 19 or 20, causing the head-stealer to attack at -1 until it can reattach the head or a replacement. If deprived of a head, it may try to rip one from the torso of an attacker. (*Author: Scott Wylie Roberts, “Myrystyr”)*

- Head-stealer: **HD** 3+4; **AC** 8 \[11\]; **Atk** 1 weapon (1d6) or strike (1d4); **Move** 12; **Save** 14; **CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**: Immune to sleep and charm.

### Headless Hound

A headless hound appears to be a large black dog, but with an eerie green glow where the head should be. The creature’s flanks may be lined with scars or torn open, exposing faintly glowing bones and the absence of innards. The headless hound attacks with a ghostly bite that passes straight through clothing and armor to the flesh. The defender’s armor class is modified only by any Dexterity bonus. Bitten flesh heals at half normal rate unless magic is used. If five or more headless hounds are present, their howling requires a saving throw to avoid fleeing in fear (only required once). The headless hound takes half damage from normal weapons. Despite their spectral nature, headless hounds are not undead. However, they are immune to sleep, charm, and hold spells. They are more properly faerie-kin, and according to folklore will cease their haunting and join the wild hunt if it passes nearby. Anyone slain by a headless hound has a chance of returning from the grave as a shadow-like spirit, to be pursued nightly by the headless hound pack. (*Author: Scott Wylie Roberts, “Myrystyr”)*

- Headless Hound: **HD** 6; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 1 bite (2d6); **Move** 18 (Fly 6); **Save** 11; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: Bite passes through armor (only dex bonus modifies AC), half normal healing rate from wounds, fear, half damage from normal weapons, immune to sleep, charm, hold.

### Helix Moth

Helix moths are 20-foot-long black insects with spiraling bands of red, green, yellow, blue, purple, and white on their abdomens. Their underbelly is white. Their large mandibles are gray, as are their legs. Three sets of translucent wings protrude from the insect’s body. A small black sword-like stinger protrudes from the end of the moth’s abdomen, capable of delivering a highly toxic poison. If the moth beats its wings, the droning sound is audible up to 60 feet away and causes *confusion* (as per the spell) in all who fail a save.

- Helix Moth: **HD** 12; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 1 bite (2d4), sting (2d6 + poison); **Move** 12/30 (flying); **Save** 2; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 13/2300; **Special**: Immune to charm, drone, poison

### Helix Moth (Larva)

Helix moth larvae are 10-foot-long maggot-like creatures with rubbery gray flesh. Their cylindrical body is about 4 feet in diameter. Their entire body is coated in a thick, slimy mucous. Larvae have no eyes but use their other senses to detect prey. The mouth has two ridges along it that are formed of a hard, shell-like substance that function as teeth. Larvae lack most of the full-grown moth’s abilities, but their bite is still deadly and delivers a powerful regurgitated acid (1d6 damage). Once the larva bites, it grips the creature with its mouth, dealing automatic bite and acid damage until removed.

- Helix Moth Larva: **HD** 5; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d8 + acid); **Move** 6; **Save** 12; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 7/600; **Special**: Grab, acid

### Hell Moth

The hell moth looks like a giant gray moth with spiraling bands of red and black on its body. It has large, thin, reddish-hued wings. The hell moth is thought to have come from another plane, though sages are not quite sure of its exact origin. The hell moth attacks living creatures that wander too close to its lair. It otherwise resembles a large moth with an 8-foot wingspan.

A hell moth can try to wrap a human-sized or smaller creature in its body as a standard attack. If successful, it establishes a hold and bites the engulfed victim with a +2 bonus on its attack roll. Attacks that hit an engulfing hell moth deal half their damage to the monster and half to the trapped victim. A hell moth that has engulfed an opponent can detonate its body in a blast of hellish fire that deals 6d10 points of fire damage to itself and to the engulfed opponent (no save). Remember to reduce the damage dealt to the hell moth due to its fire resistance. A hell moth can immolate itself once every 3 hours, providing it survives the immolation. Creatures within 10 feet of the hell moth when it uses this ability must succeed on a saving throw or take 1d8 points of fire damage as clothes and combustibles ignite. The damage continues for another 1d4+4 rounds after the hell moth uses this ability or until the fire is extinguished.

- Hell Moth: **HD** 9; **AC** 0 \[19\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d8); **Move** 6/15 (flying); **Save** 6; **AL** N (with chaotic tendencies); **CL/XP** 11/1700; **Special**: Engulf, immolation, resistance to fire (90%)

### Hellcat

These creatures are demonic felines, often kept as pets by the denizens of the netherworlds. In some cases, they may find their way to the material planes, either by being summoned or by being sent there to serve as the ally (or tempter) of a Chaotic villain who has made a pact with the powers of darkness.

Hellcats cannot be seen in the light, and even in the darkness they are little more than a feline shape limned in strange shadow, the size of a leopard or other great cat. Like most cats of demonic persuasion or not, hellcats can be fickle in their allegiance; a hellcat may change its preferred “master,” attaching itself to a particularly Chaotic individual in preference to its original one. Most hellcats encountered on the Material Planes are female; the tomcats are rare, larger, and less capable of traveling from one plane of existence to another.

- Hellcat: **HD** 7; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 1 bite (2d6) and 2 claws (1d4+1); **Move** 12; **Save** 9; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 9/1100; **Special**: Hit only by magical weapons, 20% magic resistance.

### Hellhound

Hell hounds are fire-breathing dogs of the underworlds or lower planes. In addition to biting, they can breathe fire each round, inflicting 2hp damage per hit die (10 ft. range, saving throw for half damage).

- Hell Hound (4 HD): **HD** 4; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 13; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Breathe fire (8hp).
- Hell Hound (5 HD): **HD** 5; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 12; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 6/400; **Special**: Breathe fire (10hp).
- Hell Hound (6 HD): **HD** 6; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 11; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 7/600; **Special**: Breathe fire (12hp).
- Hell Hound (7 HD): **HD** 7; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 9; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: Breathe fire (14hp).

### Herald of Tsathogga

A herald of Tsathogga is a gigantic pale yellow-green frog with oversized monstrous eyes. In place of its legs and forelimbs are many long, writhing tentacles it uses to pull itself along the ground. The body of the thing resembles that of a massive toad. These tentacles are covered in tiny lancets that inject paralytic venom. A herald can bellow once ever 1d4 rounds in one of two ways: one sound is a trilling croak that deafens all opponents within 30 feet (save avoids), while the other is a directed sound that targets one foe within 100 feet for 4d6 points of damage (save for half). If a herald of Tsathogga rolls a natural 20 on its bite attack, it swallows its opponent whole for 3d6 points of damage per round. A herald regenerates 5 hit points per round.

- Herald of Tsathogga: **HD** 14; **AC** 1 \[18\]; **Atk** 10 tentacles (1d8) and 1 bite (2d6); **Move** 6/9 (swimming); **Save** 3; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 17/3500; **Special**: Bellow, paralysis, swallow whole, regenerate, half damage from blunt weapons

### Hieroglyphicroc

Raised by ancient methods long forgotten or suppressed, hieroglyphicrocs resemble zombie crocodiles, but they are actually more akin to mummies than to zombies, at least in terms of the preservation process. Their eyes glow with a yellow light, and they have rudimentary intelligence - often they are defenders of tombs where mummies are found. These creatures are highly immune to being turned, and attack with a bite that can swallow whole on a natural 20. It takes three rounds to completely swallow a victim, but the victim will turn into a zombie within 1d4+1 rounds after being swallowed. Then the hieroglyphicroc will disgorge it. The bite inflicts 2d6 damage. The dead skin of these creatures is often painted with hieroglyphs. (*Author: Matt Finch)*

- Hieroglyphicroc: **HD** 7; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 1 bite (2d6); **Move** 9; **Save** 9; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: swallow whole on natural 20, transform stomach contents into [zombie](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Zombies).

### Hippocampus

The hippocampus is a mythical sea-horse, with the body, head, and forelegs of a [horse](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Horses), but with the rear part of the body tapering to a fish’s tail. They are at least as intelligent as a normal land-horse. Some leaders might be extremely intelligent indeed.

- Hippocampus: **HD** 4; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d4); **Move** (Swim 24); **Save** 13; **AL** L; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: None.

### Hippocampus (II)

A hippocampus is often called a merhorse or sea horse, for it is indeed a half-horse/half-fish creature of the sea. The hindquarters of the animal are that of a great fish. Its body is covered in fine scales in the fore parts and large scales elsewhere. The hippocampus’ scales vary in color from ivory to deep green, with shades of blue and silver. Aquatic races often tame these animals, and they make fine steeds, for they are strong, swift, and very intelligent. A hippocampus is about 8 feet long and weighs about 600 pounds. Hippocampuses speak the language of merfolk and tritons, and about 10% speak common. Though they are unable to move on land, a hippocampus can breathe air and survive out of the water for 15 minutes.

#### Training a Hippocampus

A hippocampus requires training before it can bear a rider in combat. To be trained, a hippocampus must have a friendly attitude toward the trainer. Training a friendly hippocampus requires six weeks of work and the assistance of an animal trainer. Riding a hippocampus requires an exotic saddle. A hippocampus can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless he or she succeeds on rolling 1d20 under their dexterity score, with fighters subtracting their level from the roll.

Hippocampus eggs are worth 1,500 gp apiece on the open market, while young are worth 2,500 gp each. Professional trainers (usually tritons) charge 1,000 gp to rear or train a hippocampus.

A light load for a hippocampus is up to 300 pounds; a medium load, 301-600 pounds; and a heavy load, 601-900 pounds.

- Hippocampus: **HD** 4; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** Bite (1d4) or tail slap (1d6) or butt (1d4); **Move** 0/2 (swimming); **Save** 13; **AL** L; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: None

### Hippogriff

The hippogriff is similar to a griffon, having the head, foreclaws, and wings of an eagle, but instead of the body of a lion, it has the body of a horse. The poem *Orlando Furioso* (written by the poet Dante in 1516) suggests that the hippogriff is the offspring of a griffon and a horse—but they are apparently an independent breed, for folkloric tradition holds that griffons frequently attack hippogriffs. Hippogriffs are not as hard to train as griffons—again, from *Orlando Furioso*: “Drawn by enchantment from his distant lair, The wizard thought but how to tame the foal; And, in a month, instructed him to bear Saddle and bit, and gallop to the goal; And execute on earth or in mid air, All shifts of manege, course and caracole…”

- Hippogriff: **HD** 3+1; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d6), 1 bite (1d10); **Move** 18 (Fly 24); **Save** 14; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: None.

### Hippopotamus

Hippopotami are very aggressive and territorial. A herd may be led by a large bull with 8HD, a saving throw of 8, and damage of 3d6 (CL/XP 8/800).

- Hippopotamus: **HD** 7; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 1 bite (2d6); **Move** 6 (Swim 12); **Save** 9; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 7/600; **Special**: None.

### Hoar Fox

Hoar foxes are silvery-gray foxes with sapphire colored eyes. They hunt in packs and can often be found lairing near settled areas. Hoar foxes are often hunted for their fur as it brings a handsome sum on the open market. While attacking a hoar fox with fire seems like a sensible solution (given their vulnerability to it), such an attack destroys its pelt and renders it worthless. Three times per day, a hoar fox can expel a blast of frigid ice in a 30-foot cone. A creature in the area takes 2d6 points of cold damage (saving throw for half damage).

- Hoar Fox: **HD** 2; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** Bite (1d6); **Move** 15; **Save** 16; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**: Breath weapon, immunity to cold, double damage from fire, surprise on roll of 1-3 on 1d6

### Hoar Spirit

Hoar spirits are believed to be humanoids that freeze to death and are doomed to haunt the icy wastes. A hoar spirit appears much as it did in life, though its body is gaunt and rotting, and its clothes are tattered. Its skin is pale gray with ice crystals randomly located on its form. Its hands end in wicked claws with pale blue, nearly translucent nails. Its eyes are frozen solid and show no signs of life. Any strike with by the creature’s claws deals an extra 1d4 points of damage from the intense cold radiating off its body, and a victim must save or be paralyzed for 1d4+1 rounds. A hoar spirit can unleash a *cone of cold* once per day.

- Hoar Spirit: **HD** 4; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d4 + cold) or 1 weapon (1d8 + cold); **Move** 6; **Save** 13; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: cone of cold (1/day), immune to cold, paralyze

### Hobgoblin

Hobgoblins are simply large goblins, possibly a separate breed living apart from their smaller cousins, or perhaps not, as the Referee decides. As a matter of the campaign’s flavoring, the Referee might choose to make hobgoblins the “fey” goblins of Irish legend, while regular goblins are the more Tolkien-style underground-dwellers.

- Hobgoblin: **HD** 1+1; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 1 weapon (1d8); **Move** 9; **Save** 17; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 1/15; **Special**: None.

### Homonculus

A homunculus is a living, man-like creature created by a powerful magic-user as a servant. The precise abilities of a homunculus depend upon the spells and procedures used in its creation (the details of creating a homunculus are left to the Referee), although virtually all are created with wings of some kind. The most common homunculus has a sleep-inducing bite (saving throw), but others might be created with a poison bite (CL 4/120XP), or might have unusual powers of perception instead (such as the ability to detect magic, evil, spells, etc).

- Homunculus: **HD** 2; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d3 + sleep); **Move** 6 (Fly 20); **Save** 16; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**: Sleep-inducing bite.

### Hornet, Giant

Giant hornets are 9-foot- long insects with black bodies and white markings on their thorax and abdomen. Giant hornets attack by biting their foes, only relying on their stingers when threatened. During combat, they release a pheromone that agitates all other giant hornets in the area, making them more aggressive (+1 attack, damage).

- Giant Hornet: **HD** 7; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** bite (1d3) or sting (1d4 + poison); **Move** 1/24 (flying); **Save** 9; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: Poison, pheromone

### Horsefly, Giant

Giant horseflies are 8-foot-long, black hairy flies. Their bodies are thick and their multifaceted eyes are black and dark gold. Their wings are translucent and their legs are long, bristly and jet black. Females have a slightly longer mouth tube than males. A giant horsefly that successfully bites an opponent latches on to drain the creature’s blood for 1d4 points of damage per round until dislodged.’

- Giant Horsefly: **HD** 4; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d6); **Move** 3/15 (flying); **Save** 13; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: Blood drain

### Horses

- Horse, Riding: **HD** 2; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d2); **Move** 18; **Save** 16; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 2/30; **Special**: None
- Horse, War: **HD** 3; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d2), 2 hooves (1d3); **Move** 18; **Save** 14; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**: None.

### Hound of Chronos

Hounds of Chronos, also known as Temporal Dogs, are canine creatures from the Plane of Time (or a time-related other dimension). They possess the innate ability to manipulate time in a limited manner. Temporal Dogs hunt in packs that usually consist of 2 to 8 hounds. A Hound of Chronos will always know where, temporally, the other members of his pack are. Hounds of Chronos possess the ability to move forward in time. Twice per day, a Hound of Chronos may “jump” forward in time. This allows the hound to disappear from the present and reappear 1d4 rounds later. The Hounds use this ability in conjunction with surprise to get the drop on their prey. When they re-materialise 1 to 4 rounds into the future, their prey has a chance of being surprised (60%).

Once per day, a Hound of Chronos may shift backward in time to when it was healthier, returning “immediately” with full hit points. (*Author: Skathros)*

- Hounds of Chronos: **HD** 3; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d4), Bite (1d6); **Move** 18; **Save** 14; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Temporal jump, Temporal heal.

### Hound of Ill Omen

The hound of ill omen (only one is thought to exist) is a legendary monster that appears when a living creature offends his/her deity. The hound appears as a shadowy, translucent wolf about 5 feet tall at the shoulder. Only the creature that offended his deity can see the hound, and only he is affected by the hound’s attack. The hound cannot be attacked or driven away by any known means.

The hound of ill omen unleashes a booming howl (audible only to its intended target) that curses the target. This curse causes the next 1d10 wounds the target takes to automatically deal double damage.

Until the target suffers the requisite number of wounds, no form of natural healing cures any damage the target takes. Likewise, any caster attempting to cast a healing spell on cursed target must succeed on a saving throw or the spell has no effect on the cursed creature.

The victim receives no save to avoid the howl’s effects and it cannot be removed by any means short of a god’s magic, but if *remove curse* is cast on the target within 10 minutes after the howl, the effects of the curse are halved (i.e., only 1d5 wounds automatically confirm as critical hits).

### Huecuva

Huecuva are the undead spirits of good clerics who were unfaithful to their god and turned to the path of evil before death. As punishment for their transgression, their god condemned them to roam the earth as the one creature all good-aligned clerics despise — undead. Huecuva resemble robed, worm-ridden skeletons and are often mistaken for such creatures. Three times per day, a huecuva can disguise their appearance with an illusion that makes them appear to be a normal cleric.

A huecuva attacks relentlessly until either it or its opponent is dead. During combat, if a lawful cleric attempts to turn a huecuva and fails, the huecuva concentrates all attacks on that cleric, ignoring all other opponents until the cleric or the huecuva is dead.

People struck in combat by the huecuva’s claws must pass a saving throw or come down with a fever. The fever incubates for 1d3 days before its symptoms appear. Once the incubation period is over, the disease inflicts 1d3 points of constitution and dexterity damage each day until the diseased victim passes a saving throw at a -3 penalty.

- Huecuva: **HD** 2; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** Claws (1d4+1 plus disease); **Move** 12; **Save** 16; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Change self, disease, silver or +1 weapons to hit

### Huggermugger

A huggermugger appears as a 3- to 4-foot-tall humanoid with short, cropped, black hair, hidden beneath a black hat, pulled low so as to hide its facial features. Its skin is pale and cold to the touch, regardless of the actual temperature in the surrounding area. A huggermugger’s normal attire, in addition to its hat, is a robe of black or dark gray. Huggermuggers do not speak, other than the incessant chattering and mumbling they seem to constantly indulge in. If three or more huggermuggers surround an opponent and begin chattering, it causes *confusion* in the creature (as per the spell).

- Huggermugger: **HD** 2; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 1 weapon (1d4); **Move** 6; **Save** 16; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 2/30; **Special**: Confusion

### Humans

Humans are such a versatile race that any number of “monsters” and NPCs can be made from them. Berserker warriors, tribesmen, cavemen, princesses, evil high priests, captains of the guard, foot-soldiers, and tavern-keepers are all different human “monsters.” Don’t try to build your non-player characters according to the rules for player characters. Just make up their stats and abilities as you see fit.

- Human (common): **HD** 1d6hp; **AC** 9 \[10\]; **Atk** 1 weapon (1d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 18; **AL** Any; **CL/XP** B/10; **Special**: None.

#### Bandit

Bandits are roving groups of thieves, sometimes organized into small armies led by more powerful bandit chiefs and captains with higher hit dice.

- Human Bandit: **HD** 1; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 1 weapon (1d8); **Move** 12; **Save** 17; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 1/15; **Special**: None.

#### Berserker

Berserkers are normal humans, but they fight with astounding ferocity. A bonus of +2 is added to their attack rolls. They do not wear armor heavier than leather armor.

- Human Berserker: **HD** 1; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 1 weapon (1d8); **Move** 12; **Save** 17; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 2/30; **Special**: +2 to hit in berserk state.

#### Sergeant-At-Arms

Human sergeants are normally found in command of 1d6+5 human soldiers. These are the leaders of city guard units and other small military groups.

- [Human](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Humans) Sergeant: **HD** 3; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 1 weapon (1d8); **Move** 12; **Save** 14; **AL** any; **CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**: None.

#### Soldier

Human soldiers serve as city guardsmen, mercenaries, and men-at-arms. They are generally armed with leather armor and a mace, sword, or spear.

- [Human](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Humans) Soldier: **HD** 1; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 1 weapon (1d8); **Move** 12; **Save** 17; **AL** any; **CL/XP** 1/15; **Special**: None.

### Hydra

Hydrae are great lizard-like or snake-like creatures with multiple heads. Each head has one hit die of its own, and when an individual head takes that much damage, that head dies. The body has as many hit dice as the total of the heads, so it is a matter of good strategy for adventurers to focus either on killing heads (when all the heads are dead the body dies) or killing the creature by attacking the body (in which case the heads die, too). Hydrae that breathe fire or regenerate their heads are also known to exist.

- Hydra (5 headed): **HD** 5; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 5 heads (1d6); **Move** 9; **Save** 12; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 7/600; **Special**: None.
- Hydra (6 headed): **HD** 6; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 6 heads (1d6); **Move** 9; **Save** 11; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: None.
- Hydra (7 headed): **HD** 7; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 7 heads (1d6); **Move** 9; **Save** 9; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 9/1100; **Special**: None.
- Hydra (8 headed): **HD** 8; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 8 heads (1d6); **Move** 9; **Save** 8; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 10/1400; **Special**: None.
- Hydra (9 headed): **HD** 9; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 9 heads (1d6); **Move** 9; **Save** 6; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 11/1700; **Special**: None.
- Hydra (10 headed): **HD** 10; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 10 heads (1d6); **Move** 9; **Save** 5; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 12/2000; **Special**: None.
- Hydra (11 headed): **HD** 11; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 11 heads (1d6); **Move** 9; **Save** 4; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 13/23000; **Special**: None.
- Hydra (12 headed): **HD** 12; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 12 heads (1d6); **Move** 9; **Save** 3; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 14/2600; **Special**: None.

### Hyena

Hyenas are pack-hunters and scavengers, known for the eerie laughing sound they make. They are not normally much of a threat, although they may attack weak-looking foes if they have sufficient numbers.

- Hyena: **HD** 1; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d3); **Move** 16; **Save** 17; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 1/15; **Special**: None.

### Hyena, Giant

Giant hyenas stand 8ft tall at the shoulder, and are more aggressive than their normal cousins. They might serve as mounts for tribes of gnolls in prehistoric or sword & sorcery campaigns.

- Giant Hyena: **HD** 5; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 1 bite (2d6); **Move** 18; **Save** 12; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: None.

## I

### Igniguana

Igniguanas are large lizards about six feet long, with reddish hide and glowing eyes. They may be of some sort of elemental origin, coupling attributes of fire and earth, for they crawl directly through solid rock without digging, leaving no tunnel behind to mark their passage. They breathe small but intense blasts of fire, in a cone extending 20ft to a width of 20ft. Anyone within the cone takes 2d6 hit points of damage (save for half). (*Author: Matt Finch)*

- Igniguana: **HD** 4; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d6); **Move** 6; **Save** 13; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Breathes fire, tunnel.

### Imp

Imps are demonic creatures sent or summoned into the material plane. They are about a foot tall, and have small but functional wings. An imp can polymorph itself into one or two animal forms: a crow, goat, rat, or dog being common. Imps regenerate 1 hit point per round, and can be hit only by silver or magical weapons (or by animals with 5+ hit dice). In some cases, they may be forced to serve as a familiar to a powerful and evil magic user.

- Imp: **HD** 2; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 1 sting (1d4 + poison); **Move** 6 (Fly 16); **Save** 16; **CL/XP** 6/400; **Special**: Poison tail, polymorph, regenerate, immune to fire, hit only by magic weapons.

### Inaed

Inaed are invisible, intangible spirits that inhabit books, scrolls and any other object upon which words are written. They possess no ability to attack directly; however, they can cast each of the following spells twice daily: *sleep, phantasmal force,* and *suggestion.* Inaed inhabiting a book or other object are entirely impervious to physical attacks, for an attack directed at the Inaed only damages the “home.” If its host book is completely destroyed, the Inaed will flee in search of a new book to haunt - including spell books. Though they are not undead, Inaed may be cast out of the books they haunt with a successful turning attempt. Treat Inaed as though they were Ghouls for this purpose. Books that have been freed of any Inaed, and books that have been blessed by a Cleric of 9th level or higher, are immune to infestation. “Turned” or otherwise unbound Inaed immediately seek out the nearest book to inhabit. Entering a book takes 2d4 turns, and it is during this time that Inaed are most vulnerable. The creatures are visible during this time -- appearing as ghostly apparitions of adolescent human females -- and can be physically damaged, although only by magical weapons. (*Author: Andrew Trent)*

- Inaed: **HD** 3; **AC** 0 \[19\]; **Atk** none; **Move** 0 (Fly 18); **Save** 14; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 7/600; **Special**: Invisible, Spells, Immune to all weapons or to normal weapons (depending on state)

### Inner Child

A parasitic organism that lies dormant inside a human host, an inner child can dimensionally shift itself outside of the host’s body and return once per day. While outside it can levitate, but remains connected by a 6ft long psychic cord and cannot move further from the host than this. It resembles a smaller version of the host creature, but with a large head, feral features, and an almost vestigial body. The host creature is usually aware that it has an inner child, but (for obvious reasons) usually keeps it a dark secret.

An inner child has strong psionic abilities. It can read minds at will (per the ESP spell), “cast” charm person twice per day, cause a psychic blast at will (2d6 points of damage to all within a cone 60ft long and 60ft wide at the end, saving throw for half damage), and create a wall of mental force once per day (3ft thick, 50ft long and 50ft tall). If the host creature is killed, the inner child dies within 1d6 turns. (*Author: Chad Thorson)*

- Inner child: **HD** 3; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** psychic blast (2d6); **Move** 8; **Save** 14; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: ESP and psychic blast at will, charm person (2/day), and wall of mental force (1/day).

### Inphidian

Somewhere in humanities lost aeons a race of malformed serpentine humanoids rose, now known as inphidians.

While the truth of their origins has been long forgotten, most sages subscribe to one of two theories. The first states the creatures are the failed results of horrific experiments performed by the dark and nameless sorcerers of an ancient snake-cult in their attempts to ensorcel their followers. The second theory contends the inphidians were once a cult of snake-worshippers cursed by an ancient snake-god for some transgression against the ethos. Whatever the truth, it appears as of late that the inphidians have evolved into true race, beyond the machinations of arcane experiments or curses. While there exist several known species, recent reports describe encounters with yet unidentified inphidians and others are sure to surface as encounters with the race grow more frequent.

Inphidians, regardless of their subspecies, have viper heads in place of their hands. The creatures use these in combat to deliver a powerful bite that injects the victim with poison. Some inphidians, particularly the craftsmen, wear special gloves called *inphidian gauntlets* that let them use their hands like any other humanoid with five digits.

#### Cobra-Back Inphidian

Cobra-backs appear as roughly humanoid creatures just over 6 feet tall with a large flap of skin (known as the hood) that runs the length of their neck/spine. Cobra-backs are blue-green scaled like other inphidians, their eyes are crimson, and their forked tongue is gray. Like their brethren, their hands are actually viper heads complete with sharpened fangs that secrete a virulent poison (3d4 points of damage, save for half). When threatened or enraged, the hood of the cobra-back fans open just like that of a true cobra. A cobra-back can spit a line of poison 20 feet from its mouth every 1d4 rounds (2d6 points of damage, save for half).

- Cobra-Back Inphidian: **HD** 5; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 2 snake hand bites (1d4 + poison); **Move** 9; **Save** 12; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 6/400; **Special**: Poison, spit poison

#### Common Inphidian

A common inphidian appears as a humanoid standing about 6 feet tall. Its skin is covered with blue-green scales and its head is almost snake-like in appearance. It has no hair on its head or body. The most unusual feature of an inphidian is its hands; for where they should be, they are not. Each hand has been replaced with the head of a viper with scales of the same blue-green color as the other parts of the inphidian. Common inphidians make up the bulk of the population in inphidian communities. They are the laborers, craftsmen, workers, citizens, guards, and militia.

Once every 1d4 rounds, a common inphidian can spew forth a line of milky-white liquid that causes blindness (as the *blindness* spell) for 6 rounds to any creature struck. A successful saving throw avoids the spray. The spray has a range of 20 feet. The snake hands of the common inphidian deliver a debilitating poison with a successful bite from its snake-hands. The poison weakens the bitten victim, imposing a -2 penalty to hit and damage in melee combat.

- Common Inphidian: **HD** 4; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 2 snake hand bites (1d4 + poison); **Move** 12; **Save** 13 **AL** C; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Poison, spit poison

#### Dancer Inphidian

Most dancer/charmer inphidians appear as shapely female humanoids; lithe and elegant in their movements. A charmer’s forked tongue is gray and their eyes are crimson. Like other inphidians their body is covered in blue-green scales and where their hands should be, a viper head sprouts from each of its arms. Each viper head is of the same blue-green color and scaled like the rest of the charmer’s body. The snake head hands strike with a weak poison (1d4 points of damage), so the inphidian usually relies on its entrancing dance to charm those seeing it (as per a *charm person* spell).

- Dancer Inphidian: **HD** 3; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 2 snake hand bites (1d4 + poison); **Move** 9; **Save** 14 **AL** C; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: Poison, entrancing dance

#### Night Adder Inphidian

Usually dressed in black robes, an inphidian night adder has black scales covering its entire body. Its head is serpentine and its arms end in snake-like hands resembling a black mamba. A night adder stands 6-1/2 feet tall and weighs 190 pounds. The snake hands of a night adder deliver a deadly poison. About 40% of night adder inphidians can cast spells as a 7th-level Cleric.

- Night Adder Inphidian: **HD** 6; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 2 snake hand bites (1d6 + poison); **Move** 9; **Save** 11 **AL** C; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: Poison, spells

#### Rattler Inphidian

A rattler inphidian is 6 feet tall and about 8 feet long, with a viper head and the lower torso of a giant rattlesnake. Colors vary, but most are brown, black, or dark gray with bands and diamond-shaped patterns. Like all inphidians, its hands are viper heads. Once every 1d4 rounds, a rattler inphidian can unleash a death rattle that does 2d6 points of damage to all creatures in a 40-foot-radius (save for half). The snake hand bite of a rattler inphidian delivers a paralytic poison (2d8 points of damage, paralysis, save resists).

- Rattler Inphidian: **HD** 6; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 2 snake hand bites (1d6 + poison); **Move** 9/6/6 (climbing/swimming); **Save** 11; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 7/600; **Special**: Death rattle, paralytic poison

### Invisible Stalker

Invisible stalkers are generally found only as a result of the spell *Invisible Stalker*. They are invisible flying beings created to follow a single command made by the caster.

- Invisible Stalker: **HD** 8; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 1 “bite” (4d4); **Move** 0 (Fly 12); **Save** 8; **CL/XP** 9/1100; **Special**: Invisible.

### Iounifier

The IOUNifier is a small, intricate tangle of wires and filaments with infinitesimal motes of light dancing unpredictably within; they are no more than one inch in diameter. Their small size, coupled with the fact that they move very quickly, makes them difficult to hit with weapons. An IOUNifier projects a beam of bluish light; if any person is caught within the light, the shadow projected by the beam is a solid, material shape that manifests within one round. Once a person is caught within the light beam (requiring a successful to-hit roll by the IOUNifier), the IOUNifier can hold the person in the beam without further effort unless a wall or other very significant obstacle completely obstructs the beam. The projected “shadow” of the target is shaped exactly like the person being projected - it is constructed of wires that look like blood vessels running through and around whirring clockwork internal organs, and with a face-mask of bronze that resembles the face of the target in perfect detail. The shadow wears armor and carries equipment identical to the target’s, but these do not duplicate any magical effects of the originals.

The shadow has the same number of hit points as the living creature from which it is projected, and regenerates 3hp per round until it is killed. It will attack its original relentlessly until it is killed, whereupon it simply disappears. If the victim is killed by its projection, the projection will instantly fall upon the corpse, envelope it in its wires and filaments, and compress itself and the corpse into an IOUN stone. The IOUN stone will respond to the first person who picks it up, orbiting around that person’s head, and granting a bonus to an attribute score for as long as it continues to circle. The attribute affected depends upon the person who is compacted into the stone; if that person was a cleric, the IOUN stone adds +1 to wisdom; if the victim was a magic-user, the stone adds +1 to intelligence; otherwise, the stone adds +1 to strength.

These IOUN stones are not permanent, lasting only 1d4+1 days; some other, lost, procedure seems to be needed to make the stones last longer than this. The IOUNifier can only maintain two projections at any given time, and cannot make a second projection of the same person more than once per day. Note: attempts to use IOUNifiers for personal gain, especially by nefarious means, are quite dangerous - whatever programming drives the IOUNifier seems driven to cause ironic and dangerous consequences to those who try to manipulate them. The challenge level of an IOUNifier varies with its targets, and thus can’t be calculated ahead of time. The XP value of an IOUNifier should be approximately the same as a monster with the same hit dice as the party has levels. (*Author: Matt Finch*)

- Iounifier: **HD** 3; **AC** 0 \[19\]; **Atk** none - by projection only; **Move** 0 (Fly 25); **Save** 5; **AL** N; **CL/XP** varies; **Special**: Improved saving throw, immune to electricity, projection beam.

### Iron Cobra

The iron cobra is a construct that resembles a small, 3-foot long cobra. Its eyes give it an evil, determined and almost intelligent look. The iron cobra is most often used to guard a treasure or to act as a bodyguard to its creator, though on some occasions it can be ordered to track down and slay any creature who is within 1 mile and whose name is known by the creator.

When ordered to find a creature within 1 mile, an iron cobra does so unerringly, as though guided by magic*.* The being giving the order must have seen (or must have an item belonging to) the creature to be found.

The bite of an iron cobra is poisonous, but being a construct, it does not produce its poison. The creator must fill the iron cobra’s poison sacs. The sacs can be filled with any poison type of poison, but the poison is usually fatal. The iron cobra can inject its poison three times before its sacs are emptied. It takes 5 rounds to refill the poison sacs.

#### Iron Cobra Construction

An iron cobra’s body is constructed from 100 pounds of iron costing at least 1,000 gp. Assembling the body requires the help of an armorer and a 10th level cleric.

- Iron Cobra: **HD** 1+1; **AC** 1 \[18\]; **Atk** Bite (1d4 + poison); **Move** 15; **Save** 17; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**: Find target, poison, magic resistance 10%

### Jack-In-The-Box

At first glance, this critter appears as a brightly decorated box with a rotating handle at its side. With surprising quickness, a jester-like creature (mounted on a spring, of course!) springs from the box attacking and maiming. If concealed within its “box”, a Jack-in-the-Box has a 50% chance of surprising its foes. This chance increases to 70% if the Jack-in-the-Box is released from the box via the rotating handle. When enclosed within its box, the Jack-in-the-Box AC becomes 3\[16\].

A Jack-in-the-Box may only move by hopping, carrying its cubic abode with him. (*Author: Skathros)*

- Jack-in-the-Box: **HD** 2; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** Dagger or other small bladed weapon (1d4); **Move** 6; **Save** 16; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 2/30; **Special**: Surprise.

### Jack-O-Lantern

A jack-o-lantern is an animated plant creature brought to life by a combination of druidic magic and fey sprits. It looks like a roughly humanoid shaped tangle of vines and leaves with a large pumpkin for its head. The pumpkin-head bears a leering face that appears to have been carved there, and glows from within with an eldritch fire. The nature of the face generally reflects the alignment of the animating spirit. Once per day, the monster can spit from its mouth up to four exploding pumpkin seeds. It can spit the seeds up to 100 feet and deals a total of 8d8 points of damage divided up between the seeds. The seeds explode in a 10 foot radius and those in the area may attempt a saving throw to halve the damage.

- Jack-O-Lantern: **HD** 6; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 3 strikes (1d4) or *fire seed* (see below) or pitchfork (1d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 11; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 7/600; **Special**: Fire Seeds

### Jackal

Small, dog-like scavengers, jackals present no significant threat to a well-armed party of humans.

- Jackal: **HD** 1d4hp; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d2); **Move** 14; **Save** 18; **AL** N; **CL/XP** A/15; **Special**: None.

### Jackal of Darkness

These creatures resemble jackals with black fur, limned with a dark fire that sheds no light and burns black when the jackal emerges from the darkness. They haunt long-abandoned tombs, possibly being shackled to them as guardians by ancient magics - the relation of the jackals to their tomb-lairs is not known. They seem to be undead, in that they can be turned (as mummies), but do not appear to rot, nor do they seem to be incorporeal in any way. The black fire around the jackal acts almost like an independent creature; when the jackal is in combat, the black fire streams forth and can envelop one opponent (within 50ft of the jackal), causing 1 hit point of damage per round. The jackal can move the black fire where it wishes. (*Author: Matt Finch)*

- Jackal of Darkness: **HD** 4; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d6); **Move** 14; **Save** 13; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Black fire.

### Jackalwere

A jackalwere is an evil spirit with the body of a jackal, but it can also assume a human form. Jackalweres can cause sleep by looking deeply into a human’s eyes for a few moments (saving throw). Jackalweres can only be damaged with silver or magical weapons.

- Jackalwere: **HD** 4; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 1 bite (2d4); **Move** 12; **Save** 13; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Sleep gaze, hit by silver or magic weapons only.

### Jaculi

Jaculi are serpents with long, muscular bodies and a squat, flat heads. A mane-like ridge of sharpened bones surrounds its head. Jaculi average 8 feet long, but can grow to a length of 12 feet. Their natural coloration is a deep green fading to a dark brown near the tail and light gray on their underbellies.. Jaculi lie in wait for opponents, preferring places high above the ground where they can leap on their prey and gain surprise.

- Jaculi: **HD** 1; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** Bite (1d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 17; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 1/15; **Special**: Surprise on roll of 1-5 on 1d6

### Janni

Jann are genies not tied to any particular element, unlike the efreet and the djinn. Like other genies, they have magical powers: enlarge or shrink themselves, invisibility (5/day), and dimension door (1/day). Jann can travel into the elemental planes, even bringing others with them, but they cannot remain more than an hour and a day in another plane of existence, or they will perish.

- Janni: **HD** 6; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 1 weapon (1d8+4); **Move** 12 (Fly 24); **Save** 11; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 9/1100; **Special**: Genie powers.

### Jelly, Marsh

A marsh jelly looks like a hovering, flying jellyfish with a translucent sickly green body and four long dangling grayish-pink tentacles. When slain, a marsh jelly explodes in a blast of acid that deals 2d4 points of acid damage to anything within 10 feet. A successful save reduces the damage by half. When a marsh jelly first takes damage, its body begins pulsating and flashing rapidly, emitting an eerie greenish glow. Creatures viewing a pulsating marsh jelly are disoriented (–1 to-hit penalty) for 1d4 rounds. Opponents hit by a marsh jelly’s poison tentacles must make a saving throw or be paralyzed for 1d4 round.

- Jelly, Marsh: **HD** 5; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 4 tentacle (1d6 + poison); **Move** 4/18 (flying); **Save** 12; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 10/1400; **Special**: Death throws, disorienting glow, poison

### Jelly, Marsh (Demonic, Progeny of Jubilex)

A demonic marsh jelly looks like a larger, more sinister marsh jelly. These intelligent minions carry out the will of their slime lord. When slain, a demonic marsh jelly explodes in a blast of acid that deals 3d6 points of acid damage to anything within 10 feet. A successful save reduces the damage by half. When a demonic marsh jelly first takes damage, its body pulsates and flashes rapidly, emitting an eerie greenish glow. Creatures viewing this pulsating glow are disoriented (–2 on attack rolls) for 2d4 rounds. Opponents hit by a demonic marsh jelly’s poison tentacles must save or be paralyzed for 1d4 round.

- Jelly, Marsh: **HD** 15; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 4 tentacle (1d8 + acid plus poison); **Move** 4/18 (flying); **Save** 3; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 15/2900; **Special**: 20% spell resistance, immune to poison and acid, death throws, disorienting glow, telepathy 120 ft., poison

### Jelly, Mustard

Mustard jelly appears to be a yellowish-brown form of the ochre jelly and is thought to be a distant relative of said creature. However, the mustard jelly is far more dangerous than its supposed relative because it is intelligent. The mustard jelly gives off a faint odor of mustard plants to a range of 20 feet. The mustard jelly exudes an aura in a 10-foot radius centered on it that *slows* (as the *slow* spell) any creature in the area as long as it remains in the area and for 1d4 rounds afterward. A new save must be made each round a creature is within 10 feet of the mustard jelly.

A mustard jelly attacks by forming a pseudopod from its body and either slashing or enveloping its foes. A creature hit by a pseudopod must pass a saving throw or be constricted for automatic pseudopod damage each round.

A mustard jelly can split itself into two identical jellies, each with half of the original’s current hit points (round down). A jelly with 10 hit points or less cannot divide itself. When divided, each jelly moves faster than the original (base speed 15 feet per round).

A mustard jelly is immune to electrical effects and *magic missiles.* If targeted by an electricity effect (including area effects) or a *magic missile* spell, the mustard jelly gains temporary hit points equal to the amount of damage it would have otherwise sustained. These temporary hit points last for 1 hour.

- Jelly, Mustard: **HD** 7; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** Slam (2d4 plus 1d4 acid); **Move** 12; **Save** 9; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 12/1200; **Special**: Acid, constriction, poison aura, +1 or better weapon to hit, divide, energy absorption, resistance to cold (50%), magic resistance (15%)

### Jelly, Stun

Stunjellies are distant relatives of the dungeon-dwelling gelatinous cube. It appears as a section of ordinary wall and covers an area of at least 10 square feet. A stunjelly is 2-1/2 to 5 feet thick. A stunjelly is gray in color and slightly translucent. It gives off a mild vinegar odor that can be detected at a range of 5 feet.

When a target moves within 5 feet of a stunjelly, it attacks with its slam attack. A stunjelly’s acid does not harm metal or stone. Creatures hit by a stunjelly must pass a saving throw or be paralyzed for 3d6 rounds. Stunjellies automatically engulf paralyzed creatures, who then suffer automatic acid damage and paralysis each round. Attacks that hit an engulfing stunjelly deal half their damage to the monster and half to the trapped victim.

Stunjellies only surprise dwarves on a roll of 1-2 on 1d6.

- Jelly, Stun-: **HD** 4; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** Slam (1d6 plus 1d6 acid plus paralysis); **Move** 6; **Save** 13; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 6/400; **Special**: Acid, engulf, paralysis, camouflage, immunity to electricity, surprise on a roll of 1-3 on 1d6

### Jelly, Whip

A whip jelly looks like a bluish-gray quivering pile of goo with four long slimy tendrils jutting from its form. A whip jelly, like most oozes, is a mindless hunter that spends its time prowling the subterranean world for food. A whip jelly secretes a deadly acid that quickly dissolves organic matter but does not harm metal or stone. Any melee hit deals acid damage. Non-metal armor or clothing dissolves and becomes useless immediately unless.

- Jelly, Whip: **HD** 3; **AC** 8 \[11\]; **Atk** 4 whip tendrils (1d4 + 1d4 acid); **Move** 8; **Save** 14; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**: Acid

### Jellyfish, Hypnotic

The colors of a hypnotic jellyfish are so soothing that anyone viewing this undersea predator must make a saving throw or fall into a dreamlike trance for 1d6 turns. The jellyfish is very large, about the size of a man. Its sting carries a lethal poison.

- Hypnotic Jellyfish: **HD** 3; **AC** 8 \[11\]; **Atk** 1 sting (1d8 + poison); **Move** 0 (Swim 3); **Save** 14; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Hypnotic colors.

### Jellyfish, Monstrous

The monstrous jellyfish’s body is a translucent pink, blue, or purple hollow form resembling an inverted umbrella of sorts. A giant jellyfish’s body averages 8 feet or more in diameter, while its tentacles (trailing beneath it underwater) can reach lengths of around 50 feet or greater. Special muscles on the underside of the jellyfish’s body push water out of it, allowing the creature to swim through propulsion. Jellyfish eat anything that contacts their tentacles — usually crustaceans, fish, algae, plankton and the occaissional *water breathing* adventurer.

A monstrous jellyfish’s tentacles are highly poisonous, delivering a paralyzing poison when contacted or contacting a foe. The victim of the poison suffers 1d4 points of stinging damage and must pass a saving throw or be paralyzed for 1d6 rounds.

- Jellyfish, Monstrous: **HD** 3; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** Tentacles (1d6 plus poison); **Move** 0/6 (swimming); **Save** 14; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: Poison, transparent (surprise on roll of 1-2 on 1d6)

### Jupitor Bloodsucker (Vampire Plant)

The jupiter bloodsucker, or vampire plant, is a man-sized, seemingly ordinary plant that looks like a tangle of leaves and roots topped by four large, dark green, serrated leaves with red veins. A creature looking closely at the roots may notice that the stems are transparent and that blood seems to course through them. On the bottom of each leaf are many small, sharp thorns. These are used to attach to a victim and drain its blood.

A jupiter bloodsucker deals 1 point of constitution damage per round per vine-leaf attached to a foe. If reduced to zero points of constitution, the victim has been completely drained of blood and dies. Constitution points lost to a jupiter bloodsucker heal at the rate of 1 per hour. Prying a leaf loose requires a successful open doors check.

A victim struck by more than one vine-leaf in a round must make a saving throw to avoid being smothered by them. For every vine-leaf beyond the first, the victim suffers a -1 penalty to its saving throw. An opponent so smothered must hold his breath or die. Again, one can pry leaves loose by making a successful open doors check.

- Juputor Bloodsucker (Vampire Plant): **HD** 3; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 6 vine-leaves (1d6 plus blood drain); **Move** 3; **Save** 14; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: Blood drain, smother, double damage from fire

### Kamadan

The kamadan is a feline-like predator that may somehow be related to the displacer beast. The kamadan has coarse, yellowish brown fur and a leopard-like body and head with emerald green eyes. From its shoulders sprout six long serpents, blackish-green in color, each about twice the length of a normal human. The serpents’ eyes are reddish-yellow. It is about 9 feet long and weighs about 600 pounds. 

The kamadan is a fierce predator and highly territorial, hunting just about anything that spends too much time in its territory. The kamadan has a hunting range of about 5 or more square miles. It makes its lair under rocky outcroppings or within caves.

Kamadans are intelligent creatures and are capable of speaking the local common tongue with a thick accent, owing to their felinoid mouths.

Once every 1d4 rounds and no more than 5 times per day, a kamadan can exhale a cone of sleep 30 feet long and 20 feet wide at the base. Creatures with 4 HD or less are automatically cast into a deep slumber; creatures with 5 HD or more are permitted a saving throw to avoid drowsing.

**Poisonous Kamadan**

A variant kamadan, one with poisonous snakes, is rumored to exist. Encounters with such creatures are rare, for which most adventurers are thankful. The poisonous kamadan uses the same statistics as the normal kamadan, but each snake head delivers a deadly poisonous bite. The poisonous kamadan has a CL/XP of 7/600.

- Kamadan: **HD** 4; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d6) or snakes (1d4) and bite (1d8); **Move** 15; 
    **Save** 13; **AL** N (Chaotic tendencies); **CL/XP** 6/400; **Special**: Sleep breath

Kamarupa

A kamarupa appears as a mockery of its former flesh-bound life. Its hollow eyes and mouth are black voids, and its facial features twist and stretch into a nightmarish appearance. Kamarupa are the distorted souls of evil priests betrayed and sacrificed to their deity. Kamarupas are highly intelligent and communicate in voices similar to the screaming wind. They hate life and light. A kamarupa is roughly human-sized and weightless. They are made powerless in sunlight, and can be destroyed if caught in natural daylight.

A creature touched by a kamarupa feels the unnatural aura of the creature as it penetrates to his very soul. The chill can kill the PC unless a successful saving throw is made. The kamarupa’s gaze can also instill fear in living beings up to 30 ft. Beings meeting the creature’s gaze must make a save or become panicked for 3d4 rounds and try to flee blindly from the creature.

Once per night, a kamarupa can place a nightmare on any creature it has encountered. The target can resist the nightmare with a successful saving throw (at a -4 penalty). Any creature that succumbs to the incredibly vivid dreams suffers 1d10 points of damage.

- Keeper of The Well: **HD** 10; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** incorporeal touch (2d6 plus death touch); **Move** Fly 15; **Save** 5; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 12/2000; **Special**: Death touch, frightful gaze, nightmare.

### Kampfult (Sinewy Mugger)

This creature is a man-sized monster resembling a tree trunk with six long sinewy tendrils spaced evenly around the upper portion of its body. Six smaller tendrils located at the base of its trunk seem to aid it in locomotion. Its body is dark grayish-green and its tendrils are dark gray changing to dark green at the tips. The kampfult haunts subterranean realms in search of prey, grabbing any living creature that passes by. Creatures slain by a kampfult are slowly absorbed into the base of the trunk and digested. Kampfults do not speak, but it is thought that they can understand the language of the drow.

A kampfult attacks from surprise, waiting until its prey moves within reach and then lashing out with its tendrils, attempting to grab and entangle its prey. A kampfult rarely attacks creatures larger than itself unless it is extremely hungry. It fights until either it or its opponent is dead. Those struck by a tendril must pass a saving throw to avoid it wrapping around their neck and inflicting 1d4 points of damage automatically each round. Tendrils can be removed with a successful open doors check or severed with an edged weapon. The tendrils have an AC of 3 \[16\] and are severed with 4 points of damage.

- Kampfult (Sinewy Mugger): **HD** 2; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 6 tendrils (1d4); **Move** 6; **Save** 16; 
    **AL** N (Chaotic tendencies); **CL/XP** 2/30; **Special**: Strangle

### Kathlin

A kathlin resembles a heavy warhorse with six legs. Black or brown coats are the horse’s most common coloring, although white-coated kathlins are sometimes found. Eye color varies as much as fur color, but again brown or black seems to be most common. Kathlins can be trained to serve as mounts, and their ability to run for days without rest makes them highly prized.

- Kathlin: **HD** 4; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 2 hooves (1d6), bite (1d4); **Move** 24; **Save** 13; **AL** N; 
    **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: Endurance

### Kech

Kechs are monkey-like humanoids standing about 6 feet tall and weighing about 150 pounds. They have azure eyes and their bodies are covered in leathery scales that resemble greenish-brown leaves. Kech make their homes in trees and prefer to move through the trees rather than on the ground. They have an almost human organization and society among the various tribes and clans. Family units dwell in a single lair (usually a hollowed tree or small hut built among the branches of a leafy tree). Kechs speak their own language and have a 15% chance of speaking the common tongue.

Kechs attack from ambush, preferring to ensnare their prey in pits, traps, or the like. If faced with a weak adversary, they attack with a frontal assault, seeking to kill as quickly as possible. Slain prey is dragged into the kech’s lair and devoured at the creatures’ leisure. If a kech hits with both claw attacks, it latches onto the opponent’s body and tears the flesh for an extra 2d4 points of damage. 

A kech can move across any ground— ice, snow, mud—without leaving any footprints. Tracking a kech by nonmagical means is impossible.

- Kech: **HD** 5; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d4) and bite (1d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 12; **AL** C; 
    **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Rending claws, pass without trace, surprise on roll of 1-3 on 1d6

### Keeper Of The Well

Keepers Of The Well are semi-intelligent water spirits that enter the material world at the behest of a powerful cleric. These spirits willingly enter into a contract with the spiritual leader who brought them forth, agreeing to be bound to a particular well or spring and defend it from all creatures not part of the local village or temple. In return for its service, the Keeper of the Well is freed from the slave-like existence it would normally have on its home place or in the spirit world. A village’s Keeper of the Well is often worshipped as a minor deity. A Keeper of the Well appears as a large, snake-like column of water rising out of the opening of the well that it defends. They cannot leave the well, though they can manifest themselves from any opening tied to the local water system, instantly appearing at the desired location. Keepers of the Well are immune to fire and possess magic resistance of 75%. Spells that specifically affect water (such as Part Water) can be used to damage or affect a Keeper of the Well with results that may vary from the spell’s normal operation. (*Author: Andrew Trent)*

- Keeper of The Well: **HD** 9; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 1 "fist" (2d8); **Move** 0 (see text for special); **Save** 6; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 12/2000; **Special**: Fire immunity, Magic resistance (75%), Water teleport.

### Kelp Devil

Kelp devils are relatives of kelpies. To the casual observer, the kelp devil resembles a large colony of slow moving seaweed about 20 feet in diameter. A closer look reveals six 10-foot long pseudopods extending from its body. Kelp devils speak the common tongue.

Kelp devils are patient creatures. They lie perfectly motionless until potential prey moves within 10 feet. Once their prey is within range, they strike quickly with their pseudopods, attempting to grab an opponent. Grappled creatures are dragged underwater and drowned. Slain creatures are devoured by the kelp devil.

Twice per day, on a successful hit with a frond, a kelp devil can affect the opponent as by *charm monster*. The creature can make a saving throw to resist the effects.

Creatures hit by a kelp devil’s fronds must make a saving throw or be entwined and dragged under water to drown. Kelp devils are expert at squeezing the air from a creature’s lungs, so their victims can only hold their breath for 1 round per 2 points of constitution before they drown.

- Kelp Devil: **HD** 8; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 6 fronds (1d6); **Move** 12/18 (swimming); **Save** 8; **AL** C; 
    **CL/XP** 10/1400; **Special**: Charm, immunity to electricity, resistance to fire (50%), resistance to blunt weapons (50%), underwater concealment

### Kelpie

In their true form, kelpies are indistinguishable from normal seaweed. They are found in saltwater and freshwater, swamps, fens, and stagnated underground pools and lakes. In her human guise, a kelpie appears as a beautiful female with long flowing dark hair, emerald eyes, and soft, pale skin. She is cloaked in robes of seaweed or wears nothing at all. A kelpie often assumes a semi-human form in which her lower torso is composed entirely of seaweed. Kelpies speak the common tongue and possibly the language of merfolk and tritons.

Kelpies lie in wait for their foes, most often males, and when a target moves within range, they reshape their form to appear human. In most cases, they take the form of a drowning woman to lure the target closer. If the ruse is not detected and the opponent moves within reach of the kelpie, she attacks, attempting to drown her victim. Drowned foes are taken back to the kelpie’s lair and devoured.

Once per day, a kelpie can produce an effect identical to the *charm monster* spell. The target can make a saving throw to avoid the effects. If the save fails, the victim believes the kelpie to be a very beautiful and attractive creature, and attempts to move as quickly as possible toward the kelpie. The kelpie can automatically grapple a charmed foe, for they do not resist the kelpie’s embrace. A *charmed* foe can only hold his breath for a number of rounds equal to his Constitution. After that, he drowns*.*

Female creatures are immune to the kelpie’s *charm* ability; only males can be affected. The *charm* is negated if the victim dies, the kelpie dies, or *dispel magic* is cast on the victim.

Kelpies can survive out of the water for 6 hours.

- Kelpie: **HD** 5; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** Slam (see below); **Move** 9/12 (swimming); **Save** 12; **AL** C; 
    **CL/XP** 7/600; **Special**: Charm, amphibious, reshape form, resistance to fire (50%), telepathy 1 mile

### Khargra

Khargra resembles a human-sized cylinder covered in metallic scales. It sports three large “fins” spaced even around its circumference. Between each fin is a metal sheath from which slide long claw-like arms. A large hole in the front of its cylindrical body is lined with many small curved metallic teeth and seems to function as its mouth. A khargra is a 5-foot long cylinder and weighs about 300 pounds.

Khargras are native to the Elemental Plane of Earth and are only encountered on the Material Plane when summoned. On occasion, a khargra slips through a tear in the planar fabric and enters the Material Plane to digest ores and metals not normally found on its native plane. 

Khargras attack from ambush, preferring to wait just inside the wall of a dungeon or corridor and springing out when prey passes nearby. The khargra attempts to grab and devour any metal objects within the area. Nonmetallic objects may be bitten, but not devoured.

A khargra’s bite can tear right through armor and weapons. Khargra can bite weapons by making a successful melee attack at a -5 penalty. If a khargra misses an attack due to armor or a shield, their attack instead affects the armor. In either event, the owner of the object must roll a saving throw, rolling 1d20 and adding either the armor bonus or weapon’s damage dice and equalling or exceeding a roll of 15. If unsuccessful, the obect is ruined.

A khargra can glide through stone, dirt, or almost any other sort of earth, including metal, as easily as a fish swims through water. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other signs of its presence. A *move earth* spell cast on an area containing a burrowing khargra flings the khargra back 30 feet, stunning the creature for 1 round unless it succeeds at a saving throw. Khargra can automatically sense the location of anything within 60 feet that is in contact with the ground.

- Khargra: **HD** 6; **AC** 0 \[19\]; **Atk** 3 claws (1d3) and bite (2d8); **Move** 6/12 (burrowing); **Save** 11; 
    **AL** N; **CL/XP** 9/1100; **Special**: Ruin armor and weapons, earth glide, immunity to cold and fire

### Kheph

The Kheph are jackal-headed humanoids with a sleek black covering of body fur. Below the neck, the form of a Kheph’s body is very much like that of a muscular and well-proportioned human being, although they are larger (averaging 7 feet tall). The Kheph are an ancient species, older than mankind, and they revere evil gods forgotten or never known by most living races. Their supernatural link to planes of existence beyond material reality is very strong, and Kheph leaders are said to be able to shift between planes of existence with ease.

Warrior kheph have 8HD but no magical abilities. They usually fight with scimitars, attacking twice per round, but may (20%) be armed with bows or (20%) with polearms. Kheph priests cast spells as a cleric of 9th level, and in addition can (as an innate ability) cast *symbol of pain* and *plane shift* once per day. Kheph Magi cast spells as a magic user of 10th level, and in addition can (as an innate ability) cast *symbol of fear* and *plane shift* once per day. Kheph elders have the spell casting abilities of an 11th level cleric and magic user, and in addition can (as an innate ability) cast *symbol of death* and *plane shift* once per day. (*Author: Matt Finch)*

- Kheph Warrior: **HD** 8; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 2 scimitars (1d8); **Move** 12; **Save** 8; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: +2 to hit.
- Kheph Priest: **HD** 9; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 1 scimitar (1d8); **Move** 12; **Save** 6; **AL C; CL/XP** 12/2000; **Special**: Spells as level 9 cleric, symbol of pain, plane shift.
- Kheph Mage: **HD** 10; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 1 scimitar (1d8); **Move** 12; **Save** 5; **AL C; CL/XP** 13/2300; **Special**: Spells as level 10 magic-user, symbol of fear, plane shift.

### Khryll

Khrylls are bizarre subterranean creatures, possessed of a malevolently genius-level intellect. They have curving, jointed shells like that of a crayfish or lobster, but without claws; rather than legs, the creature has squid-like tentacles emerging from each segment of the armored body. The tentacles of a Khryll permit some kind of limited levitation; a khryll can float and maneuver in the air provided that at least two of its tentacles are in contact with the ground or a wall. They cannot rise higher than the length of the 10ft tentacles.

The origin of these creatures in the deep underworld is unknown, but they are rapacious harvesters of most other intelligent species, even to the extent of breeding slaves to serve as food. They communicate telepathically, and their primary attack is to produce a mental shockwave that necessitates a saving throw by anyone caught in the area of the cone-shaped psychic ripple. The effect of the blast depends upon how many creatures are caught within:

**1-2 creatures in area**: Natural 1 on saving throw = death, Failed save = stunned 3d6 turns, Successful save = panic for 1d10 rounds.
**3-4 creatures in area**: Natural 1 on saving throw = stunned 3d6 turns, Failed save = panic for 3d6 turns, Successful save = confused for 1d10 rounds.
**5+ creatures in area**: Natural 1 on saving throw = panicked for 3d6 turns, Failed save = confused for 1d6 turns,Successful save = confused for 1d6 rounds.

In melee combat (or at leisure if all its foes are incapacitated), Khryll hold prey with their tentacles and insert a mouth-tube into the victim to begin liquefying the internal organs. If an opponent is hit by any two of the khryll’s tentacles, the khryll has an opportunity to jab its tube-like tongue down the victim’s throat into the body cavity, and begin liquefying organs for ingestion. This inflicts 1d6 points of damage in the first round, 2d6 points of damage in the second round, 3d6 points of damage in the third round, and death in the fourth round (no saving throw). Once the two tentacles have grabbed an opponent with successful hit, no further attacks are necessary to continue holding the victim.

If the Khryll is hungry it will suck the liquefied organs through its mouth-tube as food; otherwise it will lay eggs in the prepared body, and these will hatch into khryll-spawn in 1d3+1 days.

Khryll society is quite complex and byzantine; in general no more than six of them will be encountered together at one time, but in the deepest caverns beneath the earth there are unquestionably much larger populations of them. Their cities are said to be as much vertical as horizontal, with vast schools of khryll floating up the sides of underground cliffs where they have built bizarre structures and tunnels directly into the sides of their great caverns. (*Author: Matt Finch)*

- Khryll: **HD** 8; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 8 tentacles (varies by round); **Move** 9; **Save** 8; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 13/2300; **Special**: Mental blast, liquefy internal organs, magic resistance (80%).

### Killmoulis

A killmoulis is thought to be distantly related to brownies and other small, helpful fey, though it bears little physical likeness to its kin. Standing about 1 foot tall, they do not speak except through a limited form of telepathy. The race appears to be sexless. They are unnaturally thin and a bulbous head with no chin, seemingly no mouth and an immense, trunk-like nose. A kilmoulis has pale white skin and deep blue eyes.

A killmoulis gang always tries to take up residence in places of human habitation where foodstuffs are prepared or handled, dwelling beneath floorboards or in garrets or behind pantry shelves. The killmoulis has the same loyalty to its host family and eagerness to perform chores as the brownie, but unlike the brownie they are more prone to pointless but harmless mischief.

Killmoulises are inoffensive creatures, lacking any real combat capability. They do carry dagger-like needles, however, and use these to stab and pierce their opponents. Occasionally, these needles are poisoned with whatever poison is readily available.

- Killmoulis: **HD** 1d4; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** Needle (1); **Move** 15; **Save** 18; **AL** N; **CL/XP** B/10; 
    **Special**: Magic resistance 25%, surprise on a roll of 1-3 on 1d6, telepathy 100 ft.

### Ki-Rin

Ki-rin are wind spirits, looking much like a unicorn, but with dragon-like features such as golden-scaled skin, and having a huge, flowing mane. Most are benevolent in nature, but they seldom interfere in the doings of humankind. A ki-rin can cast spells as an 18th level cleric and as an 18th level magic user.

- Ki-rin: **HD** 12; **AC** –5 \[24\]; **Atk** 1 horn (3d6), 2 hoofs (1d8); **Move** 18 (Fly 24); **Save** 3; **AL** L; **CL/XP** 18/3800; **Special**: Spells, magical powers, magic resistance (90%).

### Kobold

Kobolds are subterranean, vaguely goblin-like humanoids. They have a -1 penalty when fighting above ground. Many use slings or short bows, and they fight with short swords or spiked clubs in melee combat.

- Kobold: **HD** 1d4hp; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 1 weapon (1d6); **Move** 6; **Save** 18; **AL** C; **CL/XP** A/15; **Special**: None.

### Ko'haai

Ko’haai are large, 6-legged lizards covered in scales that coruscate with varying hues of blue. They are normally found in tropical climates where they are used as riding animals and beasts of burden by the local populace. Ko’haai possess long, powerful tongues, used to make a whip-like attack. In addition to suffering damage, the victim of this attack may have his arms pinioned if the tongue wraps around him (saving throw at -2 penalty). The bite of a Ko’haai is mildly poisonous, inflicting 1d3 points of damage (saving throw at +2 negates), and the poison has a very strange property with repeated exposures. The skin of any person who has sustained 3 or more Ko’haai bites within a week takes on a discernible bluish cast, which persists for 3d8 weeks. After six successful saving throws made against Ko’haai poison, the body develops a permanent immunity to the damaging effects of the poison, and begins to treat the poison as a mild amphetamine, providing a +1 to attack rolls and saving throws for 1d4+2 hours after being bitten (the downside to this, of course, is the damage taken from the bite itself). (*Author: Andrew Trent)*

- Ko'haai: **HD** 3; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d6 + poison) or 1 tongue (1d4 + pinion) ; **Move** 6; **Save** 14; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: Poison, pinion with tongue.

### Koi Folk

The Koi Folk are brightly colored humanoid goldfish, peaceful and amphibious peasants of Eastern lands, and generally pleasant to be around, if somewhat dull company. They are simple-minded and easily led, often prey to bullies like the Yurmp (see, “Yurmp”) or haughty local nobility. Some monks will occasionally attempt to teach the Koi Folk martial arts, and instill the drive to stand up for themselves, only to give up in frustration at these creatures’ blank-faced placidity. (*Author: Scott Wylie Roberts, “Myrystyr”)*

- Koi Folk: **HD** 2+1; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 1 slap (1d3); **Move** 9 (Swim 12); **Save** 16; **AL** L; **CL/XP** 2/30; **Special**: None.

### Komodo Dragon

Komodo dragons are very large lizards with a poisonous bite (saving throw). Death from the poison takes place in 1d4 melee rounds after the bite.

- Komodo Dragon: **HD** 2; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d6 + poison); **Move** 6; **Save** 16; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: Poison bite.
- Giant Komodo Dragon: **HD** 5; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 1 bite (2d6 + poison); **Move** 9; **Save** 12; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 7/600; **Special**: Poison bite.

### Korred

A korred has the upper torso of a small humanoid and the lower torso of a goat, thus giving it a satyr-like appearance. It has a long, flowing beard, and like its hair, is tangled and matted into frightful knots. It wears a simple leather covering on which hangs a large leather pouch. Its hair is dark and its wild, brown eyes have an almost feral-like gleam in them. Korreds speak their own language.

Three times per day, a korred can unleash a laugh that stuns all creatures within 60 feet that hear it for 1d2 rounds. A saving throw negates the effects. 

A korred can weave its hair (contained in its pouch) into animated ropes that can entangle foes. The time it takes to weave enough hair to entangle one foe is dependent on the size of the creature as follows:

**Size****    Time**
Dwarves, Halflings            1 round
Elves, Humans                      2 rounds
Ogres                                           3 rounds

A korred cannot entangle an opponent larger than an ogre.

- Korred: **HD** 6; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** Slam (1d4) or shears (1d6) or club (1d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 11; **AL** N (Chaotic tendencies); **CL/XP **8/800; **Special**: Animate hair, laugh, magic resistance (30%)

### Kraken

Kraken are gigantic squid-like monsters of malign, genius-level intelligence, residing in the black depths of the oceans. When kraken strike with their tentacles, they may wrap their prey and constrict them each round for an automatic 2d6 damage, also making the victim defenseless against the kraken’s bite. Ships may be constricted in the same way, typically requiring 18 tentacle-rounds to crush the vessel sufficiently to pull below to the kraken’s expansive undersea lair. Tentacles may be targeted individually and severed. They each have AC 6\[13\] and 16 hit points, which are not considered part of the kraken’s hit point total. Kraken retreat by jetting backwards, at which point they may release a poisonous 80ft x 80ft x 120 ft. ink cloud. For a total of four rounds, anyone within the cloud will suffer 1d4 points of damage. It is rumored that kraken possess unnatural powers to control weather and to create false lights in order to ambush or mislead sailors. (*Author: Random)*

- Kraken: **HD** 20; **AC** 0 \[19\]; **Atk** 6 tentacles (2d6), bite (3d6); **Move** (Swim 3) (Jet 21); **Save** 3; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 24/5600; **Special**: Ink cloud, constriction, control weather, create lights.

### Kuah-Lij

A kuah-lij resembles a halfling who has been stretched vertically to the height of a human. Its features are knobby and elongated. Its hair is light and downy, more akin to a soft fur than anything else, and its skin is white with pale blue undertones. They are natural tinkerers and enjoy creating bizarre contraptions.

- Kuah-Lij: **HD** 4hp; **AC** 8 \[11\]; **Atk** Weapon (1d4); **Move** 18; **Save** 18; **AL** N; **CL/XP** A/5; 
    **Special**:None

### Kurok-Spirit

A kurok-spirit is a non-human spirit that manifests as a ghostly crocodile, limned with a transparent gray fire. Kuroks can only be damaged by silver or magic weapons (or by spells). Anyone within melee attack range of the creature must make a saving throw or be paralyzed by the ghost-flames around the spirit’s crocodile body. When the kurok bites an opponent, the bite causes the temporary loss of 1d4 constitution points (recovered within 1d3 days); if a victim’s constitution drops to 0 as the result of a kurok’s bite, he dies and the spirit takes his soul to eat. (*Author: Matt Finch)*

- Kurok-Spirit: **HD** 3; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** Bite (1d4 points of constitution); **Move** 9; **Save** 14; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Drains constitution, immune to normal weapons.

### Kzaddich

This weird but benevolent race exists outside of the normal concept of time. They may come from the distant future, but could just as easily hail from the distant past or from an alternate reality altogether. When encountered, they are generally working to defy the plans of their arch-enemies, the Tsalakians (another trans-dimensional race of beings), and to organize resistance against them. The Kzaddich (singular and plural) always appear as man-sized figures, completely covered by cowled cloaks. Their own speech sounds not unlike wind chimes. When dealing with sentient creatures, they use their native telepathy. Their true form defies immediate description; uncloaked, they appear as an amalgamation of shifting, softly glowing spheres in a rough approximation of a bipedal form. The Kzaddich can slip in and out of the time-stream at will, and as a result they are exceedingly difficult to harm. They can anticipate the future actions of their opponents, resulting in their almost unhittable armor class. Moreover, they make saving throws as an 8HD creature and take half or no damage from damage-causing spells that allow saving throws, and are allowed a saving throw against spells that normally do not allow one - whether these spells cause damage or not. They are immune to all person-affecting spells (hold person, charm person, etc.) and cannot be affected by spells that affect time, such as slow or time stop. Indeed, Kzaddich can ignore the effects of these spells and even interrupt and share any beneficial effects of such magics. Kzaddich are loathe to engage in combat, but if forced, they have the innate spell-like ability to haste themselves at will. If faced with certain capture or death, a Kzaddich can, at will, simply slip into the far future or past to avoid the situation. Kzaddich have considerable mental powers. They can mentally alter the density of their bodies from a weight of 0 to 500 pounds at will, heal all damage they have suffered five times per day, levitate at will, communicate telepathically within 100ft with any creature, and read psychic impressions left upon objects. The Kzaddich do not perceive time the way others do; they can perceive the outlines of the future (90% chance to make the most favorable choice between two actions). Kzaddich can never be taken by surprise. Twice per day, a Kzaddich have the ability to create a time stop (as per the spell, with a duration of 2 combat rounds). A Kzaddich can share the time stop with another creature with which it is in physical contact. Almost nothing is known of the Kzaddich culture; they vie against the machinations of the Tsalakians on a scale that mortal creatures cannot comprehend, in a vast war that spans time and dimensions. (*Author: John Turcotte)*

- Kzaddich: **HD** 1+1; **AC** -8 \[27\]; **Atk** 2 weapons (1d8); **Move** 12; **Save** 8; **AL** L; **CL/XP** 6/400; **Special**: Haste, improved saving throws, immune to person-affecting spells, immune to time spells, escape into future, mental powers, cannot be surprised, time stop (2/day).

## L

### Lamia

Lamias are horrid, centaur-like creatures, always female. Below the female human torso is the body of a beast, usually with a lion’s forelegs and the hindquarters of a horse – but the beast-like part can vary. A lamia can cast charm person, charm monster, and suggestion once per day, these powers often being used to lure prey into the dismal and abandoned places where the lamia lairs. In addition, the lamia’s touch drains a point of wisdom permanently from the victim. Any victim whose wisdom falls to 3 or lower becomes the lamia’s slave (one or more such slaves might be used to guard the lair or even participate in luring victims to the place).

- Lamia: **HD** 9; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d6); **Move** 24; **Save** 6; **CL/XP** 12/2000; **Special**: Spells, touch drains wisdom.

### Lammasu

Lammasu are akin to angels; they are human-headed, winged lions that often serve as temple guardians and agents of divine Law. Lammasu tend to be defenders of Law, temples, and cizilization rather than being active against the forces of Chaos. If the need arises, of course, a lammasu is quite capable of taking the offensive against threats to its wards – but because they are often pledged to guard particular places, people, or objects, they will often engage other servants of Law to pursue such threats. This being the case, a high level party of Lawful characters might very well be contacted by a lammasu with a request for assistance. The lammasu are usually generous with their rewards to those who are effective allies in the battle against Chaos.

- Lamia: **HD** 6+2; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d6); **Move** 12 (Fly 24); **Save** 11; **AL** L; **CL/XP** 9/1100; **Special**: Invisibility at will, dimension door, protection from evil 10ft radius, spells (CL6).

### Lamprey, Giant

Giant lampreys are slow-moving eels with a toothy, sphincter-like mouth. Once the monster scores a hit, it fastens to the victim and drains blood automatically each round thereafter until the victim is dead. Normal lampreys aren’t really dangerous enough to merit a separate entry.

- Giant Lamprey: **HD** 4; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d6); **Move** (Swim 9); **Save** 13; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Sucks blood.

### Lamprey, Land

Land lampreys are 3-foot long, blackish-green eels with large, downward facing mouths lined with sharpened teeth. They can be found in all but the hottest and the coldest environments and prefer the dark and dampness of the subterranean world and so are most often encountered there. 

If a land lamprey hits with a bite attack, it latches onto the opponent’s body and drains 1d4 hit points per round by draining the victim’s blood. An application of fire causes the land lamprey to releases its hold and move away from the source of the flame. The lamprey can also be pulled off with a successful open doors check, though doing so inflicts 1d4 points of damage. Once a land lamprey has dealt 8 points of damage, it detaches and slithers off to digest the meal. If its victim dies before the land lamprey’s appetite has been sated, the land lamprey detaches and seeks a new target.

- Land Lamprey: **HD** 1; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** Bite (1d3); **Move** 15; **Save** 17; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 2/30; 
    **Special**: Attach, blood drain

### Lamprey, Lightning

Lightning lampreys are floating creatures about three feet long that feed upon powerful electrical currents and lightning. Schools of them drift along in the wake of storm clouds. They are not normally encountered away from electrical storms (some may sniff their way down from higher altitudes if lightning is actually striking the ground). However, they might be found in unusual magical environments where electrical discharges or lightning is plentiful. Their bite inflicts one point of damage from the sharp teeth, but also delivers an electrical shock of 1d6hp. Their bodies are extremely good electrical conductors. (*Author: Matt Finch, first appeared in Spire of Iron and Crystal)*

- Lightning Lamprey: **HD** 1; **AC** 9 \[10\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1hp + 1d6 shock); **Move** (Fly 6); **Save** 17; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 1/15; **Special**: Electrical bite.

### Lantern Goat

A lantern goat has tangled and patchy gray-and-white hair, and horns and hooves that appear to be made of stone. Its eyes are stark white. Around its neck hangs a dented and ugly iron lantern that glows with a foul amber light. The scarred and battered lantern serves to channel souls into the undead creature. It emits an ugly yellow light that causes all creatures within 60 feet who see it to flee in fear (as per the spell of the same name) if they fail a save. Any creature slain while within 60 feet of a lantern goat must save or have its soul drawn into the goat’s lantern to be digested. Only a wish can return creatures to life after they have been consumed by the lantern goat.

- Lantern Goat: **HD** 7 or 14; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 7 HD: butt (1d8) and 2 hooves (1d6); 14 HD: butt (2d6) and 2 hooves (1d8); **Move** 6; **Save** 9 or 3; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 7 HD (10/1400); 14 HD (17/3500) **Special**: Fear light, soul capture

### Lava Child

This creature is a stocky humanoid standing about 5 or 6 feet tall with sooty-black hair and green eyes. It wears crudely constructed hides of fur and leather. Its face has a curious, almost child-like appearance and seems to be imprinted with a permanent, non-changing smile. Its skin is pinkish-white. Lava children make their lairs deep underground and usually in warmer climates. Some lava children build their communities in dying or burned out volcanoes as well. Their society as a whole is reclusive, and rarely do lava children have dealings with outside races (magmin and fire elementals being the exception). Lava children speak their own gibberish-like tongue.

Lava children take one extra point of damage per caster level from water spells and suffer double damage from cold spells and effects. Lava children are immune to all earth spells and to any metal object or weapon and its effects (swords, armor, doors, walls, for example). Metal simply passes through the lava child as though it did not exist. Metal items are not destroyed, just ignored. Any metal weapon (including magic weapons) that strikes a lava child deals no damage and simply passes through its body. Likewise a lava child can simply walk through metal doors or walls as though they did not exist and ignore bonuses to an opponent’s Armor Class due to metal armor.

- Lava Child: **HD** 4; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d4) and bite (1d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 13; **AL** N; 
    **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Immunity to earth magic, fire and metal, double damage from cold

### Leaping Maw

A Leaping Maw is a weird form of parasite that has extra-dimensional properties. It is never encountered alone, as it requires a host of some form. A small creature can support only one Leaping Maw, but a medium-sized creature (such as a human) can support up to four, and a large creature can support nine or more. The Leaping Maw looks like a small, fanged mouth, rather wolf-like, sprouting from a host creature’s body. The body is a fist-sized lump, hidden within the host’s body, and the host must usually be slain in order to get to it. The Leaping Maw is able to teleport itself directly onto any flesh within 30ft, and if it scores three successful hits it has burrowed into the victim’s flesh. It cannot attack anyone who is employing a protection from evil spell. Use of a dimension door within 10ft of a leaping maw kills one leaping maw per 3 levels of the caster. Teleport will drive them out from the host. If a leaping maw remains in a host for a week, the host begins to experience surreal and vivid dreams and hallucinations that cause a permanent loss of 1 Wisdom point per leaping maw per month. When the victim reaches wisdom of 0, he becomes completely controlled by the parasites, a puppet for breeding and transmission. (*Author: Scott Wylie Roberts, “Myrystyr”)*

- Leaping Maw: **HD** 1; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d6); **Move** 0 (Teleport 30 ft.); **Save** 17; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 2/30; **Special**: Teleport, occupy host, attack against unarmored AC.

### Leech, Giant

Giant leeches are about one and a half feet long per hit die. After they score a hit, they drain blood automatically at one hit point per hit die of the creature. These are nasty creatures to find inhabiting the murky, muddy waters of a dungeon or swamp.

- **HD** 1; **AC** 9 \[10\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d4); **Move** 3; **Save** 17; **AL N; CL/XP** 2/30; **Special**: Sucks blood (1 hp/round).
- **HD** 2; **AC** 9 \[10\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d4); **Move** 3; **Save** 16; **AL N; CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**: Sucks blood (2 hp/round).
- **HD** 3; **AC** 9 \[10\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d4); **Move** 3; **Save** 14; **AL N; CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: Sucks blood (3 hp/round).
- **HD** 4; **AC** 9 \[10\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d4); **Move** 3; **Save** 13; **AL N; CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Sucks blood (4 hp/round).
- **HD** 5; **AC** 9 \[10\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d4); **Move** 3; **Save** 12; **AL N; CL/XP** 6/400; **Special**: Sucks blood (5 hp/round).
- **HD** 6; **AC** 9 \[10\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d4); **Move** 3; **Save** 11; **AL N; CL/XP** 7/600; **Special**: Sucks blood (6 hp/round).

### Leopard

Leopards are small, roaring great cats, standing about 2 ft. tall at the shoulder. They are not quite as fast as the other great cats, but they are stealthy hunters.

- Leopard: **HD** 3; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d3), 1 bite (1d6); **Move** 16; **Save** 14; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**: None.

### Lephane

The Lephane is a semi-aquatic relative of the Elephant, adapted for dwelling in rivers and lakes. The main body, resembling a boulder, is a shrivelled and shrunken mass, although it is still almost the size of a normal elephant’s. The head is barely recognizable as an elephant’s, as the ears are atrophied lumps; the trunk is much longer than that of a normal elephant. The lephane attacks by grabbing and constricting with its long, muscular trunk from underwater. Once it has struck, it can apply continuous damage per round and can drag victims underwater. If the lephane manages to drag its prey all the way to its mouth, it can also bite for 1d6 damage. In general, any creature attacking it while it is in the water will suffer a -2 penalty to hit and damage (except with spears or other good underwater weapons). Breaking free from the lephane’s trunk can be managed on a roll of 1-2 on a d6.

The lephane is an accomplished swimmer, but lazy. It prefers to walk along a river bottom, poking the tip of its trunk above the water to breathe. Like its land-bound kin, it has ivory tusks that will fetch a fine reward: 100-400gp per tusk. Unlike its land-bound kin, the lephane is omnivorous; it can survive on roots and leaves, but it prefers fresh meat. (*Author: Scott Wylie Roberts, “Myrystyr”)*

- Lephane: **HD** 7; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 1 trunk (2d4+constriction), 1 bite (1d6); **Move** 6; **Save** 9; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: Constriction, pull beneath water.

### Leprechaun

Leprechauns are fey creatures, usually portrayed as irrational and possibly quite malevolent (although they have the common fey characteristic of being bound by bargains they make). They are somewhat magic resistant (10%), and are extremely elusive. They can become invisible and dimension door at will. They can also cast phantasmal force once per day.

- Leprechaun: **HD** 1; **AC** 8 \[11\]; **Atk** 1 weapon (1d6); **Move** 18; **Save** 15; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 5/400; **Special**: Magic resistance (10%), magic abilities.

### Leprechaun (II)

Leprechauns are short fey creatures, about 2 feet tall. They favor brightly colored clothes, particularly greens and reds. Leprechauns are a jovial people, enjoying fine food and drink; some leprechauns also enjoy a good smoke from a long-stemmed pipe. They are a tricky folk and enjoy jokes and pranks, although they usually do not appreciate being the victims of such acts.

Most leprechauns are skilled pickpockets (as 8th level thieves), and it is a favored prank of these wee folk to filch items from unsuspecting travelers in their domain and then taunt the intruders into pursuit. The leprechaun so involved in the prank often alternates between being visible and invisible as he teases and pesters his pursuers in a merry chase. Leprechauns tire of pranks quickly, however, and will give up the stolen item and sneak away. Some say leprechauns are descendants of halflings and pixies. Leprechauns summarily dismiss this rumor, however, scoffing at those who repeat it.

Leprechauns can cast *invisibility* (self only), *phantasmal force*, *polymorph* (objects only) and *ventriloquism* at will.

### Leucrota

The leucrota has a badger’s head and a lion’s body, but with cloven hooves instead of claws. Its toothy mouth stretches from ear to ear (and delivers a deadly bite). The original description of a leucrota comes from Pliny the Elder, writing in the first century.

- Leucrota: **HD** 6; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 1 bite (3d6); **Move** 18; **Save** 11; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 6/400; **Special**: None.

### Lich

Liches are the undead remnants of wizards, either made undead by their own deliberate acts during life, or as the result of other magical forces (possibly including their own magics gone awry). A lich has the same number of hit dice as the original Magic-User and the same spell-casting powers. A lich’s touch causes paralysis with no saving throw, and the very sight of one of these dread creatures causes any being of 4 HD or below to flee in abject terror. Liches are highly intelligent and totally malign.

- Lich (12 HD): **HD** 12; **AC** 0 \[19\]; **Atk** 1 hand (1d10 + automatic paralysis); **Move** 6; **Save** 3; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 15/2900; **Special**: Appearance causes paralytic fear, touch causes automatic paralysis, spells.
- Lich (13 HD): **HD** 13; **AC** 0 \[19\]; **Atk** 1 hand (1d10 + automatic paralysis); **Move** 6; **Save** 3; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 16/3200; **Special**: Appearance causes paralytic fear, touch causes automatic paralysis, spells.
- Lich (14 HD): **HD** 14; **AC** 0 \[19\]; **Atk** 1 hand (1d10 + automatic paralysis); **Move** 6; **Save** 3; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 17/3500; **Special**: Appearance causes paralytic fear, touch causes automatic paralysis, spells.
- Lich (15 HD): **HD** 15; **AC** 0 \[19\]; **Atk** 1 hand (1d10 + automatic paralysis); **Move** 6; **Save** 3; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 18/3800; **Special**: Appearance causes paralytic fear, touch causes automatic paralysis, spells.
- Lich (16 HD): **HD** 16; **AC** 0 \[19\]; **Atk** 1 hand (1d10 + automatic paralysis); **Move** 6; **Save** 3; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 19/4100; **Special**: Appearance causes paralytic fear, touch causes automatic paralysis, spells.

### Lich Shade

A lich shade is a rotting and skeletal humanoid dressed in tattered and worn robes with ancient runes etched on their surface. Its eye blaze with a crimson fire. Lich shades are evil creatures who attempted to achieve lichdom but failed. A lich shade stands about 6 to 6-1/2 feet tall and weighs about 160 pounds. The robes and gowns it wears often denote its previous life’s profession. A lich shade’s touch is supernaturally cold, so any creature struck by one of its claws must save or be dazed for 1 round. When reduced to 0 hit points, a lich shade crumbles into a pile of dust equivalent to *dust of sneezing and choking*. When a spellcaster within 50 feet of a lich shade attempts to cast a spell, he must save or lose the spell as it is absorbed by the creature. The lich shade can cast the spell on its next turn, turn the spell into a bolt of magic energy (similar to a magic missile) that does 1d6 points of damage per two levels of the original spell cast, or gain a number of hit points equal to the spell level x 4.

- Lich Shade: **HD** 11; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d6 + chill); **Move** 9; **Save** 4; **AL** C; 
    **CL/XP** 14/2600; **Special**:Chill, death throes, spell leech, resists cold and electricity, spell resistance (22%)

### Lichenthrope

Lichenthropes are human (or similar) creatures that have been infected by a carefully prepared mixture of spores and alchemical ingredients. This infusion causes a condition with effects similar enough to lycanthropy that the infected victims are treated as were-creatures for all purposes except one. Because lichenthropy is an alchemical condition rather than a supernatural one, lichenthropes are not immune to normal weapons, as true were-creatures are. They are, on the other hand, still affected by magic weapons that are especially enchanted against were-creatures.

At will, a lichenthrope can take one of two non-human forms in addition to its human one. The first of these is a noisome agglomeration of fungus-material shaped somewhat like a dog. In this form, the lichenthrope is resistant to magic (25%) and immune to any sort of mental control that would not ordinarily affect a plant. The second non-human form of a lichenthrope is a formless mass of fungus with an air bladder that allows it to fly, provided that it has a full combat round to inhale air.

Lichenthropes can commune with any form of intelligent plant, although they do not exert actual control over such plants.

Any character suffering 50% damage from the attacks of a lichenthrope will begin transforming into a lichenthrope. However, since the process of lichenthropy is alchemical and normally induced directly by a creator of lichenthropes, the transformation does not always proceed in a predictable way. There is a 50% chance that an infected character will simply turn progressively into a mess of disgusting fungus over the course of 1d4 weeks. During this time, whether the transformation is proceeding normally or not, the process can be arrested and cured by the use of a *cure disease* spell. (*Author: Matt Finch)*

- Lichenthrope: **HD** 3; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 1 weapon (1d8); **Move** 12; **Save** 14; **CL/XP** 5/2400; **Special**: Shapechange, 25% magic resistance (in hound form only), contagion.

### Linnorm

Linnorms look like massive serpents with draconic heads. Linnorms never speak, nor do they have spell-casting ability. Linnorms attack with their bite which deals grievous damage and injects a deadly poison into their opponents (save or die). A linnorm may also constrict an opponent for 3d4 points of damage per round. If a linnorm attacks with its bite and 4 or more than the number needed in rolled on its attack dice, the victim is swallowed whole. Swallowed victims suffer 2d4 hit points of damage per round and may only strike back at the linnorm with short weapons. The inside of a linnorm is considered armor class 8\[11\].

Linnorms share the size categories and age categories of dragons. They are deaf, detecting heat and vibration, and are therefore unaffected by silence and invisibility. Thrice per day, linnorms may breathe a cloud of poisonous gas 30ft long, 20ft wide, and 10ft high, which deals damage equal to the linnorm’s full hit points (save for half damage). Linnorms may not be subdued and are immune to poison. They are excellent swimmers and sometimes lair in or near large bodies of water. (*Author: John Turcotte, © 2006)*

- Adult (7 HD): **HD** 7; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 1 bite (3d6 + poison) and 1 constrict (3d4); **Move** 12 (Swim 12); **Save** 9; **AL** C: **CL/XP** 9/1100; **Special**: Poison, constrict, swallow whole, immune to poison, silence and invisibility, breath weapon.

### Lion

A lioness has an **AC** of 7 \[12\], but is otherwise similar to the male lion. The first lion encountered will be male; all the rest in the encounter will be lionesses.

- Lion: **HD** 5+2; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d4), 1 bite (1d8); **Move** 12; **Save** 12; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: None.

### Lithonnite

Lithonnites are huge mollusk-like creatures, about one ton in weight, living in subterranean and surface environments. The front of a lithonnite’s body is encased in a powerful shell, even to the rock-like eyelids. When the rest of the lithonnite’s body is concealed in a grotto or under water, the shell appears like a boulder or other natural rock. It is not possible for the lithonnite to draw its soft body entirely into the shell. In combat, the lithonnite reaches around its shell with two slug-like tentacles to attack. The creature’s frontal portion, protected by the shell, can be attacked by any sort of weapon; behind the shell, the soft body is AC 6\[13\], but cannot be affected by blunt weapons due to its boneless consistency. (*Author: Matt Finch)*

- Lithonnite: **HD** 8; **AC** 2 \[17\] (frontal shell), 6\[13\] (body); **Atk** 2 tentacles (2d6); **Move** 9; **Save** 8; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 9/1100; **Special**: Body immune to blunt weapons.

### Livestone

Livestone is a strange species of ooze that can solidify itself into a consistency that very closely resembles that of stone. In its solidified form, a livestone is indistinguishable from a normal boulder or slab of rock. No one is quite sure from where livestones originated, but ancient legends say that the dwarves accidentally unleashed these horrors on the surface world by digging into their subterranean lairs. Eventually, some livestones found their way to the surface.

Livestones are incredibly long-lived, solidifying and entering a form of hibernation and remaining that way indefinitely until a food source wanders too near. Livestones have a simple chameleon-like ability to mimic local stone by ingesting a small sample and adjusting its own color and texture to match. A hibernating livestone can become covered in moss and lichens to further the deception.

Livestones generally attack from ambush, waiting for a potential meal to pass before flowing into their ooze form and rushing up to engulf the prey. If the surprise attack fails, a livestone resorts to hammering with pseudopods. When attacking in this manner, a livestone will solidify the tip of the pseudopod and strike with a hammer-like blow. A livestone’s usual tactic is to solidify the half of its body facing the prey and then send hard-tipped pseudopods out from behind this shield.

A livestone can simply mow down human-sized or smaller creatures by moving over them. It cannot make a slam attack during a round in which it engulfs. The livestone affects as many creatures as it can cover. Opponents can attempt a saving throw to avoid being engulfed; on a success, they are pushed back or aside (opponent’s choice) as the livestone moves forward. An engulfed opponent takes 1 point of damage per round as the livestone consumes it (unless the livestone solidifies itself).

A livestone that has engulfed an opponent can instantly solidify its form, dealing 8d6 points of crushing damage per round to the trapped victim (saving throw for half damage).

An engulfed creature can be freed by killing the livestone or by casting *stone to flesh* on the livestone. This deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level to the livestone and automatically ejects an engulfed victim. 

An opponent attacking a livestone must succeed on a saving throw each time his attack hits. If the save is failed, the livestone actually solidifies the portion of its body at the instant it was hit, cutting damage in half. A livestone cannot attack if its entire form is solidified. 

Livestones surprise on a roll of 1-4 on 1d6 in stony areas.

- Livestone: **HD** 5; **AC** 10 \[9\]; **Atk** Slam (1d8); **Move** 9; **Save** 12; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 7/600; 
    **Special**:Engulf, solidify, immunity to petrification, surprise on 1-4 on 1d6

### Living Lake (Agrath-Ogh)

Hundreds of feet across, a living lake is an ooze of truly colossal proportions. The protoplasmic body of a living lake is fluid in nature and transparent in water. A living lake attacks by forming pseudopods from its oozy form and pummeling its opponents. The ooze can raise a portion of itself off the ground and come crashing down on opponents who must save or be engulfed into the ooze and “drown” in the living lake. A living lake casts spells as a 9th-level druid.

- Living Lake: **HD** 16; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 4 slams (3d8); **Move** 6; **Save** 3; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 17/3500; 
    **Special**:Engulf, spells

### Lizard Samurai

Lizard samurai come from some unknown race of bipedal lizards, possibly from the spirit world, possibly from another dimension, possibly from far lands. They are only encountered in elaborate armor, bearing sharp swords and sometimes with longbows. Lizard samurai follow a strict code of combat, but consider humans of non-fighting social class to be animals virtually beneath their notice. When venturing into human lands, they are normally formed into well-organized military units, sometimes with members of some other race serving as auxiliary troops. These military units generally consist of at least 20 of the lizard samurai, and are always led by a captain with 6 hit dice. Lizard samurai make all saving throws at +1 (already reflected in the statistics). (*Author: Matt Finch)*

- Lizard Samurai: **HD** 3; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 1 sword (1d8) or 2 arrows (1d6); **Move** 9; **Save** 14; **AL** any; **CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**: Improved saving throw.
- Lizard Samurai Captain: **HD** 6; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 1 sword (1d8) or 2 arrows (1d6); **Move** 9; **Save** 11; **AL any; CL/XP** 6/400; **Special**: Improved saving throw.

### Lizard, Cavern

Cavern lizard are 8-foot-long gray lizards with wide feet and sapphire-gold bulging eyes. Their legs are thick and muscled and their large feet have small suction cup-like pads on the bottoms that aid in climbing. Its head is angular and somewhat flat. Its mouth sports a row of long, serrated teeth. These very aggressive hunters latch onto prey with their bite, automatically dealing damage each round thereafter.

- Cavern Lizard: **HD** 4; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 1 bite (2d4); **Move** 9/6 (climb); **Save** 13; **AL** N; 
    **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**:Grab

### Lizard, Fire

Fire lizards are often called “false dragons.” Despite their general resemblance to dragons, sages have as yet found no evidence of these creatures being in any way related to them. Fire lizards look like wingless dragons with gray scales dappled in red and brown. Its underbelly is bright red and its yes are black with yellow pupils. A fire lizard is averages 30 feet long but can grow to almost twice that size. Fire lizards do not associate with or keep company with dragons. Once every 1d4 rounds, a fire lizard can breathe fire in a 20-foot cone. Creatures in the area take 2d6 points of fire damage (saving throw for half).

- Fire Lizard: **HD** 10+1; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d8), bite (2d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 5; **AL** N; 
    **CL/XP** 11/1700; **Special**:Breathe fire, immunity to fire, double damage from cold

### Lizard, Giant

Giant lizards (the ones described here, in any case) are about 4ft tall at the shoulder (not quite large enough to ride). Larger specimens could certainly be found – perhaps they continue to grow throughout their long lives, leading to giant lizards of close to saurian dimensions.

- Giant Lizard: **HD** 3; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d8); **Move** 12; **Save** 14; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**: None.

### Lizard, Gnasher

A gnasher lizard is typically 10 feet to 20 feet long and weighs about 1,000 pounds. Gnasher lizards have a wide gaping maw filled with double rows of dagger-like teeth. Its head is large and flat and sports a ridge of hardened bone that runs the length of its head before tapering off near the middle of its back. Its four legs end in large, flat clawed feet. A gnasher lizard that rolls 4 or higher than needed to hit a creature swallows the victim whole. If the lizard rolls a natural 20, it severs an opponent’s limb.

- Gnasher Lizard: **HD** 8; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d8); **Move** 10; **Save** 8; **AL** N; 
    **CL/XP** 7/600; **Special**:swallow whole, severing bite

### Lizard, Lightning

Lightning lizards stand 5-ft. in height and may reach a length of 14ft. Their scales are a shimmering blue and sparks of lightning constantly crackle around their maw. Lightning lizards have sometimes been used as mounts for powerful orcish chiefs or tribal lords.

A lightning lizard may spew a crackling stream of lightning to assault its foes twice per day. A successful save halves the damage. Lightning lizards are immune to electrical based attacks or spells.

A rare breed of flying lightning lizards are known to exist. They are identical to their earthbound kin with the addition of massive wings which give them a flying movement of 18 (which adjusts the CL/XP to 8/800). (*Author: Skathros)*

- Lightning Lizard: **HD** 5; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d4), 1 bite (1d8) or Lighting Blast (4d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 12; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 6/400; **Special**: Lightning blast.

### Lizardman

Lizardmen are reptilian humanoids, both male and female, usually living in tribal villages in the depths of fetid swamps. Some can hold their breath for long durations (an hour or more), while others can actually breathe underwater.

- Lizardman: **HD** 2+1; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d3), 1 bite (1d6); **Move** 6 (Swim 12); **Save** 16; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 2/30; **Special**: Breathe underwater.

### Lobster-Giant

The Lobster-Giants are strange and rare creatures, living in swamps and remote coastal shallows. They are not related either to giants or to lobsters, save for the fact that they are indeed a bizarre form of intelligent (albeit somewhat stupid) crustaceans. In addition to a pair of large pincers, lobster-giants have a ridge of smaller “arms” along the length of the underbelly, and these smaller limbs are coated with a paralytic poison.

Lobster-Giants attack with their two pincers, and if they succeed in hitting an opponent with both pincers, they have also managed to grab hold and hug the opponent to their chests, where the smaller limbs can scrabble through armor and scratch with the poison. A victim who has been grabbed will suffer an additional 2d6 attacks, and for of these that hits a saving throw is required to avoid being paralyzed for 1d10 turns. A character is allowed to attempt breaking out of the giant’s pincer-grip each round, which is done by rolling 4d6. If the resulting number is equal to or lower than the character’s strength, the character has escaped. (*From Black Monastery, detailed by Matt Finch)*

- Lobster-Giant: **HD** 10; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 2 pincers (2d6); **Move** 9 (Swim 9); **Save** 5; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 12/2000; **Special**: Grab for 2d6 extra paralysis attacks when hitting with both pincers.

### Lurker Above

The lurker above is a subterranean carnivore that preys on any living creatures that enter its territory. It looks something like a massive manta ray. Its body is black on the top and gray on the underbelly. A lurker’s underbelly tends to blend in with stone, allowing a lurker pressed against a ceiling a 4 in 6 chance to surprise opponents below.

Lurkers above are extremely territorial and are never encountered with others of their kind. Mating habits among lurkers is unknown to sages as no two of these creatures have ever been encountered together. A typical lurker above has a hunting territory of several square miles.

A lurker above can try to wrap a creature in its body as an attack that ignores armor bonuses to Armor Class. If successful, it establishes a hold and deals buffet damage each round the hold is maintained. A wrapped opponent must hold its breath or suffocate. A grabbed opponent can hold her breath for 2 rounds per point of constitution. Attacks that hit an engulfing lurker above deal half their damage to the monster and half to the trapped victim.

**Lurker Below**

The lurker below is an aquatic variety of lurker above that makes its lair in any body of water and in any climate (though it rarely lairs in extremely cold climates). Lurkers below are pale blue or black in color and are often mistaken for giant manta rays. Lurkers below cannot fly, but have a swim speed of 15. They are otherwise identical to their land-based counterparts detailed above, except they lie in wait on the sea floor and attack from below.

- Lurker Above: **HD** 10; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** Buffet (1d8); **Move** 6/15 (flying); **Save** 5; **AL** N; 
    **CL/XP** 12/2000; **Special**:Amorphous, smother, half damage from blunt weapons

### Lurker, Ceiling

Lurkers resemble floating manta rays, with a rough, stone-like undersurface. They levitate to ceiling-tops and wait for prey to walk underneath, whereupon they drop and enfold the victim in their thick “wings” (to-hit roll). Anyone trapped inside a lurker’s clutches takes 1d6 points of damage per round from crushing, and will suffocate within 1d4+1 rounds unless the lurker is killed. There is normally only a 10% chance to detect a lurker’s presence visually before it attacks, and it has a 65% chance to gain initiative automatically (unless a “surprise roll” system is being used, in which case the lurker has a 4 in 6 chance to gain surprise).

- **HD** 10; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 1 crush (1d6); **Move** 1 (Fly 7); **Save** 5; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 12/2000; **Special**: Smother.

### Lycanthropes

Lycanthropes are were-creatures, particularly those in whom the disease permits assumption of a hybrid form of the human and animal. They cannot be hit by normal weapons: only silver and magical weapons affect them. If anyone is attacked and brought below 50% hit points by a lycanthrope, the person will become a lycanthrope himself.

#### Werebear

Werebears are often found in temperate forests. On an attack roll of 18+ (natural roll) with its claws, the werebear grabs its victim and hugs it for an additional 2d8 points of damage.

- **HD** 7+3; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d3), 1 bite (2d4); **Move** 9; **Save** 9; **AL** N or C; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: Lycanthropy.

#### Wereboar

Wereboars are often found in the remote wilderness.They can take the form of a boar, a human, or a boar-like biped.

- **HD** 5+2; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 1 bite (2d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 12; **AL** N or C; **CL/XP** 6/400; **Special**: Lycanthropy, hit only by magic or silver weapons

#### Wererat

Wererats are often found in cities, lurking in shadowy alleyways. Wererats can control rats, and are extremely stealthy, surprising opponents on 1–4 on a d6.

- **HD** 3; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d3), 1 weapon (1d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 14; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: Lycanthropy, control rats, surprise, hit only by magic or silver weapons.

#### Weretiger

Weretigers are often found in tropical cities and ancient jungle ruins, but will appear in more temperate climates as well, if tigers live in the surrounding wilderness. These lycanthropes can assume the form of a tiger, a human, or a bipedal, tiger-like hybrid of the two forms.

- **HD** 6; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d4), 1 bite (1d10); **Move** 12; **Save** 11; **AL** N or C; **CL/XP** 7/600; **Special**: Lycanthropy, hit only by magic or silver weapons.

#### Wereweasel

Wereweasels tend to be aggressive, cruel and vicious. In their lycanthrope form, they are sleek and quick, biting for 2d4 hit points of damage in addition to any weapons they may wield. They continue to drain blood after a successful bite, inflicting an additional 2d4 points of damage per melee round until slain or until they release their prey. As with other were-creatures, the bite also has a chance to inflict lycanthropy. These lithe creatures are fast, gaining a +1 bonus on initiative rolls. Wereweasels are often found with 1d4 giant weasels, which obey their commands. In human form, wereweasels tend to be thin and wiry, dark of aspect with sharp features. (*Author: John Turcotte)*

- **HD** 3+2; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d6) and weapon (1d8); **Move** 15; **Save** 14; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Drain blood, lycanthropy, +1 initiative, hit only by magical or silver weapons.

#### Werewolf

Werewolves are the traditional Lycanthropes seen in horror movies. They can turn into a wolf or into a wolf-man. Wolvesbane keeps them at bay.

- **HD** 4+4; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d6+1); **Move** 12; **Save** 13; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Lycanthropy, hit only by magic or silver weapons.

### Lynx, Giant

If a giant lynx hits with both of its front claws, it can make 2 more attacks with its rear claws. These large cats are found in the cold wilderness, where they hide in trees waiting for prey, then leap to the attack. They are highly intelligent, and can communicate with each other when coordinated action is needed. As with the common lynx, giant lynx are well camouflaged, and if waiting in ambush they will surprise opponents (5 in 6 chance).

- **HD** 2; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d2), 1 bite (1d4); **Move** 12; **Save** 16; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 2/30; **Special**: Rear claws, surprise

### Lythic

Lythics are 5- or 6-foot-tall humanoids composed of smoothly-carved rock. Their features are human-like but emotionless. Related to earth elementals, lythics are shy creatures that tend to flee rather than confront people. They are experts at blending into stone, and use this camouflage technique to seemingly vanish if threatened. Lythics can glide effortlessly stone and dirt like a fish through water.

- Lythic: **HD** 3; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 2 slams (1d4+2); **Move** 12/18 (burrowing); **Save** 14; **AL** N; 
    **CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**:Earth glide, blend with stone

## M

### Macaw, Giant

Giant macaws are not predators, but they are highly territorial and very dangerous, being as large as a tall man. They have brilliant green, blue, or red plumage, and are generally found in tropical regions. The giant macaw attacks with a wickedly powerful beak. They are ordinarily found in mated pairs, and their feathers can usually be sold for a tidy sum. (*Author: Matt Finch)*

- Giant Macaw: **HD** 5; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 1 beak (1d10); **Move** 6 (Fly 20); **Save** 12; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: None.

### Magmoid

Magmoids are large, sentient, spherical balls of liquid fire and rock about 10 feet across. Small bubbling pockets on the magmoid’s form serve as sensory organs. A giant magmoid, measuring 30 feet across is thought to exist, though none have ever seen it. A magmoid attacks by spraying a blast of superheated magma at opponents or by slamming into and rolling over them. The magmoid’s body is composed of molten rock that melts any nonmagical weapon that hits it. Once every 1d4 rounds, a magmoid can release a line of magma up to 40 feet (2d6 damage, save for half).

- Magmoid: **HD** 8; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 1 flaming slam (2d6); **Move** 9; **Save** 8; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 9/1100 
    **Special**:Melt normal weapons, magma blast, immune to fire, *sleep* and poison

### Magnesium Spirit

Magmoids are large, sentient, spherical balls of liquid fire and rock about 10 feet across. Small bubbling pockets on the magmoid’s form serve as sensory organs. A giant magmoid, measuring 30 feet across is thought to exist, though none have ever seen it. A magmoid attacks by spraying a blast of superheated magma at opponents or by slamming into and rolling over them. The magmoid’s body is composed of molten rock that melts any nonmagical weapon that hits it. Once every 1d4 rounds, a magmoid can release a line of magma up to 40 feet (2d6 damage, save for half).

### Malcarna

Malcarnae are female creatures with a four-armed human torso and the lower body of a great, writhing serpent, fifteen feet long. These horrible creatures are one of the many possible teratomorphs that may result from human congress with demons, most commonly an incubus. In some cases they may also be hatched from clutches of eggs laid by Marilith demons following events too hideous to contemplate. When they are born into any but the most depraved human societies they are usually killed at birth, so they are seldom found upon the material planes. Malcarnae generally arm themselves with a shield and three weapons, and can also attack with their lashing tails for 1d8 points of damage. Despite the horrible shape of these creatures, they are obscenely beautiful; creatures of fewer than 4 hit dice cannot attack them, and opponents with 4 or more hit dice must make a saving throw to succeed with any attempted physical attack. They are immune to normal weapons (other than silver ones) and have magic resistance of 25%. The human parentage of the malcarnae prevents them from being turned by a cleric. Some malcarnae may have clerical spell casting ability. (*Author: Matt Finch, first appeared in Footprints magazine)*

- Malcarna: **HD** 5; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 1 tail (1d8) and up to 3 weapons (1d8); **Move** 12; **Save** 12; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: Magic resistance 25%, hit only by magic or silver weapons.

### Malformian

Malformians are the result of magical breeding experiments. They are ugly human-like creatures, often of misshapen proportions, crossbred by insane wizards from humans, goblinoids, animals, and even beings summoned from other worlds. No two malformians look alike; one might be covered in warts and tufts of fur, a second might have useless atrophied wings growing from its back, a third might have eyes and hands of mismatched sizes, and so on. Their various deformities tend to hinder their movement. Any weapons and possessions will be makeshift in nature, such as clubs, staves, crudely stitched cloaks, etc. Gangs of malformians make hideouts in wilderness ruins or subterranean lairs; they do not interact with civilization except as occasional predators and raiders. (*Author:* *Scott Wylie Roberts, “Myrystyr”)*

- Malformian: **HD** 1+2; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 1 weapon (1d6); **Move** 9; **Save** 17; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 1/15; **Special**: None.

### Mammoth

Mammoths are huge, shaggy precursors to elephants, larger and more feral, with great, curving tusks. They might be trained as mounts by snow-barbarians. If a lone mammoth is encountered, there is a 50% chance that it is sick or old (no more than 4hp per HD) and a 50% chance that it is a young bull (no fewer than 4hp per HD).

- Mammoth: **HD** 12; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 1 trunk (1d10), 2 gore (1d10+4), 2 trample (2d6+4); **Move** 12; **Save** 3; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 13/2300; **Special**: None.

### Mandragora

The mandragora is a vaguely humanoid looking plant creature with mottled green and brown flesh. Its lower roots are splayed and resemble legs and feet. Its upper roots are long and resemble humanoid arms. Its head, if it could be called that, is a mass of solid vegetable matter covered in lumps. The mandragora stands about 5 feet tall and weighs about 120 pounds.

The mandragora is carnivorous and relishes the taste of human flesh. If it goes more than three days without devouring flesh, it burrows into the ground and attaches to local tree roots, from which it draws its sustenance until living prey can be found.

A mandragora attempts to grab its prey and strangle it, inflicting 1d4 points of damage per round. Slain creatures are covered in a thick layer of mucus and slime and devoured at the mandragora’s leisure.

Abrupt exposure to bright light stuns the mandragora for 1 round. On subsequent rounds, they are dazzled and suffer a -1 penalty to hit as long as they remain in the affected area.

- Mandragora: **HD** 1; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 2 tentacle slaps (1d4); **Move** 12/9 (burrowing); 
    **Save** 17; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 3/60**Special**:Constrict, light blindness, resistance to fire (50%), magic resistance (10%)

### Mantari

Mantari sustain themselves on a diet of rats, carrion, and subterranean plants, but prefer the taste of fresh meat, particularly humans and gnomes. Mantari appear as large manta rays, gray in color, with a long smooth tail that ends in a sharpened barb. The mantari flies silently through its underground world in search of prey, and when encountered, it is often hungry and immediately attacks.

- Mantari: **HD** 1; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** Tail sting (1d6); **Move** 3/24 (flying); **Save** 17; **AL** C; 
    **CL/XP** 2/30**Special**:None

### Manticore

This horrid monster has bat wings, the face of a feral human, the body of a lion, and a tail tipped with 24 iron spikes. The manticore can hurl up to 6 of the iron spikes from its tail per round, at a maximum range of 180 ft.

- Manticore: **HD** 6+4; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d3), 1 bite (1d8), 6 tail spikes (1d6); **Move** 12 (Fly 18); **Save** 11; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: Flies, tail spikes.

### Mantidrake

A mantidrake is a cross between a dragon and a manticore. A typical mantidrake is about 10 to 12 feet long and weighs about 1,100 to 1,300 pounds. Its draconic head is scaled and is the same color as its dragon parent. A mantidrake’s breath weapon depends on its dragon heritage. Regardless of its type, a mantidrake’s breath weapon is usable once every 1d4 rounds, deals 5d8 points of damage, and allows a save for half damage: black, 60-foot line of acid; blue, 60-foot line of lightning; green, 30-foot cone of gas; red, 30-foot cone of fire; and white, 30-foot cone of cold). A mantidrake has 24 iron spikes on its tail. It can hurl up to 6 of the spikes per round, to a maximum range of 180 feet.

- Mantidrake: **HD** 9+2; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d3), 1 bite (1d8), 6 tail spikes (1d6); 
    **Move** 12/18 (flying); **Save** 6; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 10/1400;**Special**: breath weapon, spikes

### Mantis, Giant Praying

The giant praying mantis is ten feet long, with a bark-like exoskeleton which makes it blend well into forest terrain (desert varieties have chitin with a sand-like texture). The huge insect attacks with blinding speed, usually by surprise, reaching forth with its jointed, serrated front limbs to grab prey. If the mantis hits, and the victim fails a saving throw, the forearms not only do damage but pull the victim close to the mantis’ mouth. The victim is held thereafter (not helpless, but unable to pull away) with the mantis doing automatic damage with the serrated forearms and also attacking with its bite for an additional 1d12 points of damage (rolls required to see if the bite hits).

- Giant Praying Mantis: **HD** 8; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 1 grab (1d12); **Move** 9; **Save** 8; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 9/1100; **Special**: Bite (1d12).

### Marble Snake

The marble snake has whitish-gray scales, translucent in places where its underlying veins can be seen. The snake’s head is long and has a large lion-like mane of golden fur. Two long sharp fangs protrude from its mouth. Its multi-faceted eyes are red. A typical marble snake is 10 feet long and can grow to a length of 20 feet.

Unlike normal snakes, it adapts very well to its environment, hence it can be found just about anywhere, though underground encounters are rare. The marble snake prefers sunlight and warmth to the cold and darkness of dungeons and caverns and most often makes its lair in high, sunny altitudes. 

Typically an encounter is with a single marble snake. In instances where more than one is encountered, they will a mated pair and young. A female marble snake is usually only encountered during mating season (when she lays 1d10 eggs). Marble snake eggs are milky-white with gray-brown flecks. An egg can fetch up to 5 gp on the open market.

A marble snake can whistle, gaining the attention of any creature within 50 feet that hears it. All creatures (other than marble snakes) with the area must succeed on a saving throw or become entranced. An entranced victim walks toward the marble snake, taking the most direct route available. If the path leads into a dangerous area, that creature gets a second saving throw. The effect continues for as long as the marble snake whistles and for 1 round thereafter. An entranced victim is effectively dazed, and cannot attack, but can defend itself. If an entranced opponent is attacked, the effect is immediately broken.

- Marble Snake: **HD** 3; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** Bite (1d6); **Move** 9/9 (climbing); **Save** 14; **AL** N; 
    **CL/XP** 4/120;**Special**: Whistle

### Marrosian Statue

Marrosian Statues are animated statues of human warriors created from a rare, magical marble-like stone frequently used by a lost civilization. Marrosian Statues move with a silent, fluid grace that belies their inorganic nature. Creatures damaged by a Marrosian Statue must make a saving throw or suffer from a deep, soul-chilling cold that radiates outward from the wound. Failure results in a -2 to all subsequent saving throws and combat rolls. This penalty dissipates over the course of the following 24 hours.

Marrosian Statues are partially immune to damage from slashing and piercing weapons, taking only half damage from these sources. (*Author: Andrew Trent)*

- Marrosian Statue: **HD** 3; **AC** 1 \[18\]; **Atk** 1 stone weapon (1d8); **Move** 12; **Save** 14; **AL** Any; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Soul Chill, Slashing/Piercing Resistance.

### Maun-Ge

The Maun-Ge are transparent-skinned humanoids. They live alone among humans in remote settlements, usually wearing lacquered wooden masks and an enveloping outer garment that cloaks the entire body. All Maun-Ge are female and will eventually mate with a human male to produce a sole Maun-Ge child. They are able to commune with the spirits of their ancestors who offer guidance, praise and censure to their descendant. With the ability to draw upon the knowledge and experience of their forebears, the Maun-Ge are revered as sages and storytellers. Those who interact with them at length come away feeling somewhat enlightened (+1 wisdom for 2d4 days). The Maun-Ge know the True Names of all men (treat as a Geas Spell), using this knowledge to command humans to play a part in their schemes to increase and perpetuate their bloodline’s influence, status and power. (*Author: Sean Wills)*

- Maun-Ge: **HD** 1; **AC** 9 \[10\]; **Atk** dagger (1d4); **Move** 12; **Save** 17; **AL** L; **CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**: Geas.

### Mawler

A mawler’s natural form is that of a small blob of fleshy stuff approximately 2 feet across. Mawlers are rarely ever seen in their natural form, however, as they almost always take the shape of an article of clothing. A mawler can alter its texture, color and shape to match such substances as leather and metal. A single mawler usually takes on the form of a single article of clothing, such as a hat, helmet, scarf, codpiece or belt. A pair of these creatures encountered together can take the shape of a pair of boots or a pair of gloves. A mawler radiates as magic, which often lures victims to it who detect magic on the item the mawler is mimicking. When an unsuspecting person dons the mawler, it attacks with its bite. If a mawler hits, it automatically constricts for 1d4 points of damage in the next round. If a mawler rolls a natural 20 on its bite attack, it severs whatever appendage is within it at the time (a leg or hand, for example).

- Mawler: **HD** 4; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** Bite (1d4); **Move** 6; **Save** 13; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 5/240; 
    **Special**:Constrict, mimic shape, radiate magic, vorpal bite

### Mechanisms

Mechanisms are, effectively, magically-constructed robots. They are not merely animated, for they have a mechanical component to their operations, but these mechanical components require magic in order to function.

#### Bronze Cobra

Bronze cobras are similar to iron cobras, built in ancient days by powerful spell casters as mechanical servants using powerful magic. These jointed snakes are the size of a normal cobra, and follow commands given to them or programmed into them by their creators. Bronze cobras are not as lethal as iron cobras, being made of softer metal and having a five-dose supply of paralysis poison (3d6 turns) rather than a three-dose supply of lethal poison. They are, however, faster than the similar mechanism created from iron.

- Bronze Cobra Mechanism: **HD** 2; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d2 + poison); **Move** 12; **Save** 16; **AL** N;**CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**: Non-lethal paralysis poison.

#### Clockwork Cavalier

A clockwork cavalier is a metallic humanoid (usually plated with tarnished bronze), elaborately forged to resemble a handsome, mustached gentleman, with a winding mechanism (a key) in its back between the shoulder blades, and armed with a sword extending from its right forearm. Once it has been wound up, the cavalier will wait in place until it can perceive a male humanoid armed with a sword, whom it will challenge to fight a duel to the death. If the opponent declines, the cavalier will accuse him with cowardice, and attack the following round. During combat the Cavalier will mock its opponent with a selection of insults and taunts. Any other combatants striking the Cavalier will also become targets. A Cavalier never flees from a fight.

The cavalier grows slower as it winds down. Each successive round it is in combat it gains a -1 to hit and to its movement rate. Eventually it comes to a complete halt (once movement rate reaches 0, in 12 rounds) and is thereafter totally unable to move or fight (although the insults continue for a further 1d4 rounds). Clockwork cavaliers are immune to Sleep, Charm and Hold, and to all non-magical piercing weapons. Any two-handed sword or axe that hits has a 1 in 6 chance of beheading the Cavalier - which causes it to halt and then explode within the next round (burst radius 20ft, 1d6 damage - a successful saving throw means that a person caught in the blast only takes half damage). (*Author: Sean Wills)*

- Clockwork Cavalier: **HD** 5; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 1 sword (1d8); **Move** 12; **Save** 13; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Slows down, immune to sleep, charm, hold, and non-magical piercing weapons, explodes if beheaded.

#### Giant Robot

Throughout time, every evil genius yearns deep in his heart to create a giant robot armed with a heat ray and machine guns - even (or perhaps especially) in worlds where the height of technology is represented by hammer-pounded iron, waterwheels, and crossbows. With the aid of magic, madness, and perseverance, however, some such evil geniuses succeed in the task against all odds. And then, there might be beings who live in the deserts of Mars, and beyond the dark void of the night sky. One never knows. Giant robots are 13-15 ft. tall. They tend to be sleek in design and most highly advanced. These heavy combat robots have machine guns for hands (each making four attacks per turn), a chest-mounted mortar (damages all in a 5-ft. radius of the target), and can fire a cone of heat from its head that is 90ft long and 30ft wide at its end, that inflicts hit points equal to the robot’s initial hit points (save for half damage). (*Author: Scott Casper)*

- Giant Robot: **HD** 15; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 8 machine gun shots (2d6), mortar (4d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 3; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 19/4100; **Special**: Heat ray.

#### Iron Cobra

Iron cobras are a type of eldritch mechanism, created by the great wizards of yore using formulae from their legendary spellbooks and tomes of knowledge. They are jointed constructions of iron, the size of a normal cobra, that slither and attack as commanded (perhaps eons in the past) by their makers. The iron cobra contains a reservoir with three doses of lethal venom. Larger specimens might have been built, with an addition venom dose per additional hit die.

- Iron Cobra Mechanism: **HD** 3; **AC** 1 \[18\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d4 + poison); **Move** 9; **Save** 11; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Poison.

### Medusa

The terrifying medusa has a female face but hair of writhing snakes; it has no legs, but the body of a serpent. The gaze of a medusa turns anyone looking upon it into stone. In addition to the medusa’s relatively weak melee-weapon attack, the snake-hair makes one attack per round, causing no damage but inflicting a lethal poison with a successful hit (saving throw applies).

- Medusa: **HD** 6; **AC**8 \[11\]; **Atk** 1 weapon (1d4); **Move** 9; **Save** 11; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: Gaze turns to stone, poison.

### Medusa, Greater

A greater medusa looks like its lesser kin except that it has the lower torso of a giant snake. The greater medusa is a rare form of the normal medusa. They are very solitary creatures and dwell far from civilization, rarely leaving their lairs. In all other respects, they behave as the normal medusa. 

A greater medusa’s gaze turns people to stone and their snakes’ fangs are poisonous. The blood of a greater medusa is highly poisonous even to the touch. A creature contacting the blood must succeed on a saving throw or take 2d6 points of damage. The blood loses its potency one hour after being exposed to air.

- Medusa, Greater: **HD** 8; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** Shortbow (1d6) or dagger (1d4) and snakes (1d4 plus poison); **Move** 12; **Save** 8; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 10/1400;**Special**:Petrifying gaze, poisonous blood

### Melgara

The Melgara (singular and plural) are a humanoid race from an alternate world. They appear to be tall, slender, blue-skinned women, dressed in silvery-grey robes and sandals, with long pale hair, and slitted eyes. They have six digits per extremity, plus an extra thumb on the left hand, and live for 200 to 350 years. All members of the Melgara race are mystical and introspective by nature, given to meditating upon philosophy, cosmology, and emotional awareness. They consider most other races to be psychologically impaired, and will communicate with them as condescending parents or teachers to slow or stunted children. The Melgara arm themselves with staffs and wands of a strange, durable crystal found on their world. The staff deals 2d4 damage. The wand, when used as a striking weapon, deals 1d4 damage in addition to 1d4 rounds of a Slowing effect or a Stunning effect (saving throw negates). The Melgara can also channel mental energy through these crystal weapons (3 times per day), causing any one of the following more powerful effects with a successful Attacks: (1) Paralysis for 1 turn, (2) Sleep for 1 hour, or (3) Charm for 1 full day. Each member of the race has spell ability equal to a cleric of level 2, and some have spell casting ability of up to level 5. They do not, however, have the ability to turn undead. In addition to clerical spell casting, all melgara can cast the magic-user spells sleep, shield, blur, and ESP, although these spells take up a clerical spell “slot”. Once per day, they can increase their own speed, allowing a bonus of 2 to armor class (AC 5\[14\]). In any group of melgara, one will possess a crystal pendant or silvery rod of unusual design. These items have no combat function, being ceremonial devices on the Melgaran homeworld. (*Author: Scott Wylie Roberts, “Myrystyr”)*

- Melgara: **HD** 3+2; **AC** 7 \[12\] or 5\[14\]; **Atk** 1 staff (2d4) or wand (1d4 + stun or slow); **Save** 14; **Move** 12; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Spells (1 level 1), mentally augmented attack (hold, sleep, or charm), increase speed.

### Melhukiskata (Sap-Snatcher)

The hunters of the northernmost forests share that terrain with many strange and dangerous beasts. One such predator is the melhukiskata, or “sap snatcher.”

So stealthy is the melhukiskata that it is rare for one to be spotted on the move. Those who have seen them report that its body is three feet long, shaped like a weasel or badger, but can walk like a bear. It is covered with shaggy, grey-brown fur all over, down to the tip of its two-foot long tail. Its mouth is elongated and oddly eel-like, while its feet are wickedly taloned. The most unusual features of the beast, though, are its fingers -- for instead of forepaws, the melhukiskata has fingered hands. Odder still, the fingers are long and stiff, and grow out like antlers. The longest of these antler-like fingers yet seen on a melhukiskata were five feet long.

The sap on the hands holds fast anyone touched and also is a weakening contact poison (save vs. poison or lose 1d6 points of strength per round, causing loss of consciousness at 2 strength or lower). Anyone so held can be automatically bitten each round and will be held until the melhukiskata is killed, the adhesive is burned away, or is washed off with vinegar or alcohol. All lost points of strength will be regained in 1d6 hours.

Tracking the melhukiskata is difficult, for when it does travel it often walks backwards, dragging its huge fingers behind it as if to sweep away its trail. Perhaps because of this so many folktales describe the melhukiskata as a clever animal. More likely, such behavior is instinctive. In no other regard does it appear to be smarter than a dog. (*Author: Scott Casper)*

- Melhukiskata: **HD** 2; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 1 antler-hand (0), bite (1d6-1); **Move** 9; **Save** 16; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: Strength-draining poison, holds fast.

### Memory Child

A memory child is an otherworldly being whose sole purpose is the collecting of memories. A memory child looks exactly like an ordinary child (male or female) about 7 or 8 years old. Regardless of its actual age, a memory child never seems to grow up or grow old. A memory child can absorb an opponent’s thoughts and memories by touch. Draining memories is painful and does 1d6 points of damage to the victim. Alternatively the touch of a memory child can flood the opponent’s mind with every single thought the child has ever collected from those that have come into contact with it. This effect overloads the opponent’s brain, dazing it for 1d6+2 rounds and confusing it for 1 hour (treat as a *confusion* spell). A successful save negates the stunning effect and reduces the confusion effect to 1 minute. A memory child can use *ESP* at will.

- Memory Child: **HD** 8; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** Mind drain (1d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 8; **AL** N; 
    **CL/XP** 8/800;**Special**:Mind flood

### Memory Moss

Memory moss appears as a 1-foot square patch of black moss. It grows in temperate or warm climates and is sometimes encountered in subterranean realms (though not often). Memory moss cannot abide the cold or the arid clime of the desert and is never encountered in such environments.

When a living creature moves within 60 feet of a patch of memory moss, it attacks by attempting to steal that creature’s memories. It can target a single creature each round. A targeted creature must succeed on a saving throw or lose all memories from the last 24 hours. This is particularly nasty to spellcasters, who lose all spells prepared within the last 24 hours. 

Once a memory moss steals a creature’s memories, it sinks back down and does not attack again for one day. Any creature who loses its memories to the memory moss acts as if affected by a *confusion* spell for the next 1d4 hours. Lost memories can be regained by eating the memory moss that absorbed them. Doing so requires a saving throw, with failure resulting in the creature being nauseated for 1d6 minutes and suffering 2d4 points of damage.

A creature that eats the memory moss temporarily gains the memories currently stored therein (even if they are not the creature’s own memories). Such creatures can even cast spells if the memory moss has stolen these from a spellcasting creature. Creatures eating the memory moss to regain their own lost memories do not lose them after 24 hours. Fire and cold kills a single patch of memory moss.

When first encountered, there is a 25% chance that the memory moss has eaten within the last day and does not attack by stealing memories. In such a case, the moss contains 2d4 spells determined randomly. When a living creature moves within 60 feet of a sated memory moss, it assumes a vaguely humanoid form and casts the stolen spells at its targets.

### Mephit

Mephits are minor spirits usually related to fire and heat, that can, from time to time, be loosed on the Material Planes by natural means (such as a volcanic eruption) or by supernatural means (such as being summoned by wizards or sent on errands by demons or devils). All of these creatures have the ability to turn into a (mephitic) bad-smelling gaseous form for 1d6 rounds, once per day.

#### Brimstone Mephit

As with other mephits, brimstone mephits are elemental creatures; they are sly, but not highly intelligent. They spit a reeking cloud of yellowish gas that is 20ft long, by 10ft tall, by 10ft wide. This cloud is choking and caustic, inflicting 2d6 points of damage to anyone caught inside, with a saving throw allowed to reduce the damage to half. The mephit’s own gaseous form is not poisonous, although it smells foul. When in gaseous form, the mephit cannot be attacked other than with spells that would affect gas, but it cannot attack, either. (*Author: Matt Finch)*

- Brimstone Mephit: **HD** 3; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d3); **Move** 12 (Fly 20); **Save** 14; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Breathe gas cloud, gaseous form.

#### Fire Mephit

Fire mephits are minor fire imps, cunning, but not terribly intelligent. They are often servitors of more powerful demonic or infernal beings, and may occasionally be found on the material planes under the circumstances described in the general description of mephits, above. A fire mephit can breathe flame for damage of 1d8+1, half if the victim makes a saving throw. The fire has a range of 20ft. When in gaseous form, the mephit is visible and foul-smelling; it cannot be attacked other than with spells that would affect gas, but it also cannot attack.

- Fire Mephit: **HD** 3; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 2 fiery touches (1d3+1); **Move** 12 (Fly 20); **Save** 14; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Breathe gas cloud, gaseous form.

#### Lightning Mephit

A lightning mephit is a winged imp about 4 feet tall and weighs about 1 pound. It breathes a 15-foot cone of lightning (1d8 electricity, save for half). Once per day it can call down a bolt of lightning for 2d6 points of damage. A successful save halves the damage. Once per day, a lightning mephit can attempt to summon another lightning mephit with a 25% chance of success. 

- Lightning Mephit: **HD** 2; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d2 + 1d4 electricity); **Move** 12/18 (flying); 
    **Save** 16; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 2/30; **Special**: breath weapon, immune to electricity, summon mephit

#### Smoke Mephit

A smoke mephit is a winged imp about 4 feet tall and weighs about 1 pound. It breathes a 15-foot cone of hot soot (1d4 points of fire damage, save for half). Living creatures that fail their saves are tormented by burning eyes that impose a –2 to-hit penalty for 3 rounds. Once per day, the mephit can create a downpour of white-hot embers in a 20-foot radius that causes 2d6 points of fire damage to creature in the area. A successful save halves the damage. Once per day, a smoke mephit can attempt to summon another smoke mephit with a 25% chance of success. 

- Smoke Mephit: **HD** 2; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d2); **Move** 12/18 (flying); 
    **Save** 16; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 2/30; **Special**: breath weapon, immune to fire, summon mephit

### Merman

Mermen have the torso of a human and the lower body of a fish. Although the race is called “mermen,” there are female members as well.

- Merman: **HD** 1; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 1 weapon (1d6); **Move** 1 (Swim 18); **Save** 17; **AL** Any; **CL/XP** 1/15; **Special**: Breathe water.

### Midnight Peddler

The midnight peddler appears as a normal human, cloaked in a long gray hooded robe. A long protruding, sharp jaw can be seen under the hood. He wanders city streets and is normally only encountered on fog-covered nights. He is first detected by the audible squeaking of the cart he pushes, the sound growing louder as he draws closer. The midnight peddler moves with a slow gait as he pushes his wooden cart. The contents of his cart vary each time he visits the Material Plane, but at any given time, he has available any item listed in the equipment section with a value of 50 gp or less. The midnight peddler speaks the common tongue.

The touch of the midnight peddler drains 1d4 levels to a living creature.

The peddler provides advice and answers correctly any one question asked of him by any creature who buys something from his cart.

The midnight peddler can plane shift to any inner or outer plane as a move action. His cart (and any non-living matter contained therein) shifts with him. This ability otherwise functions as the spell of the same name.

- Midnight Peddler: **HD** 7; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** Touch (death chill); **Move** 9; **Save** 9; **AL** N; 
    **CL/XP** 10/1400;**Special**:Death chill, divination, plane shift

### Mihstu

Mihstus are semi-solid creatures from the Elemental Plane of Air. They are found in cool, damp, dark areas such as ruins, dungeons, and underground caves and caverns. The mihstu can shape its body at will and almost always appears on the Material Plane as a cloud of swirling vapor. It can seep through small cracks and openings.

When threatened, a mihstu forms four tentacles from its body. Each tentacle ends in a razor-sharp, barb-like talon. A mihstu can try to wrap a creature in its body as an attack that ignores the victim’s armor bonus to Armor Class. Even while engulfing a victim a mihstu can still use its tentacles to strike at other targets. A mihstu deals 1d2 points of constitution damage to an engulfed opponent each round the hold is maintained.

Ranged attacks (including *magic missile*) used against a mihstu have a 50% miss chance. Cold-based attacks and effects deal no damage to a mihstu, but stun it. If the cold-based effect allows a saving throw and the mihstu succeeds on its save, it ignores the stun effect. If it fails its save, or if the effect doesn’t allow a save, the mihstu is stunned for 1d4+2 rounds.

- Mihstu: **HD** 8; **AC** -3 \[22\]; **Atk** 4 tentacles (1d6); **Move** 9/9 (flying); **Save** 8; **AL** C; 
    **CL/XP** 13/2300;**Special**:Constitution damage, engulf, +1 or better weapon to hit, immunity to electricity, resistance to missile attacks, magic resistance (15%), susceptible to cold

### Mimi

A mimi resembles a 1-foot-tall elf with small, bee-like wings, silver hair, milk white skin, and icy blue eyes. A mimi dresses in brightly colored clothing, preferring garments of blue, silver, or green. Mimis avoid combat, but blast foes with a *cone of cold* (once per day) if disturbed. They turn *invisible* (at will) and flee if threatened.

- Mimi: **HD** 2hp; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 1 dagger (1d4); **Move** 3/18 (flying); **Save** 16; **AL** N; 
    **CL/XP** 1/15;**Special**:Spell-like abilities

### Mimic

Mimics are formless creatures that imitate surrounding features they have seen. In subterranean settings, they might be disguised as an archway, treasure chest, door, etc. When touched, they glue themselves to the victim with a strong adhesive, while striking with a suddenly-formed tentacle.

- Mimic: **HD** 7; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 1 smash (2d6); **Move** 2; **Save** 9; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: Mimicry, glue.

### Minotaur

The minotaur is a man-eating predator, with the head of a bull and the body of a massive human, covered in shaggy hair. Most are not particularly intelligent.

- Minotaur: **HD** 6+4; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** Head butt (2d4), 1 bite (1d3) and 1 weapon (1d8); **Move** 12; **Save** 11; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 6/400; **Special**: Never get lost in labyrinths.

### Mire Beast

Mire brutes, when dormant, appear as large stretches of mud bristling with wooden stakes. Once per day a mire brute can vomit forth a spray of fetid water to a range of 30 feet. The spray contains small biting insects and worms. Treat these vermin as a *creeping doom* spell.  A mire brute can try to impale smaller opponents.  An impaled opponent immediately takes 4d6 points of damage and is stuck on the stakes jutting from the mire brute’s body. The stakes protruding from a mire brute’s body are filthy and diseased. A saving throw is allowed (versus poison). The effects of the disease are decided by the Game Referee.

- Mire Beast: **HD** 15; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 2 fists (3d6); **Move** 9/20 (swimming); **Save** 3; **AL** N; 
    **CL/XP** 15/2900;**Special**:Disgorge vermin, disease, impale, magic weapon required to hit, immune to fire

### Mirror Fiend

Mirror fiends inhabit mirrors. They appear as emotionless humans staring out of the reflective surface to the world beyond. If a mirror fiend locks his gaze with someone looking into the mirror, the victim must make a successful saving throw or have his soul sucked into the mirror, while his body remains motionlessly staring at himself in the mirror. While within the mirror, the victim’s actions are controlled by his immobilized self as the mirror fiend attacks the victim’s mirror-self. The victim’s mirror-self suffers -4 to his first attack due to being unfamiliar with the mirror-image environment, but the penalty is reduced by 1 in each subsequent round. Should the immobilized victim’s gaze be moved away from his mirror-self, he will no longer be able to control his movements within the mirror, and the mirror-self will become a motionless target for the mirror fiend. Slaying the mirror fiend will restore the victim’s soul to his body, but shattering the mirror will forever trap the soul within the mirror. Mirror fiends are immune to attacks from normal weapons, and are 50% resistant to magic. Weapons used from outside will likely shatter the mirror, and spells used from the outside will reflect back upon the caster rather than enter the mirror-realm. (*Author: Skathros)*

- Mirror Fiend: **HD** 8; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 1 mirror weapon (3d4); **Move** 12; **Save** 8; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 10/1400; **Special**: Unaffected by normal weapons, 50% magic resistance.

### Mist-Men

Mist men are humanlike forms summoned from some other plane of existence or dimension, often stored in small containers until they are freed to take their full shape when the container is opened.

Once every four rounds, a mist man can breathe out a heavy cloud of choking mist in a 15 foot cone. Anyone caught in the cone must make a saving throw or be blinded by the noxious fumes for 1d4+1 rounds. The mist persists in an area for 1 full turn. (*First published in The Black Monastery, adapted by Matt Finch)*

- Mist Men: **HD** 4; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 1 fist (2d6); **Move** (Fly 18); **Save** 13; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Exhale mist.

### Mite

Mites are thought to be distant relatives of the goblins. Mites live their lives deep under the surface of the earth and are never encountered on the surface world. While sunlight does not harm a mite, it prefers the darkness and dampness of its underground realm. 

Common mites speak their own language of garbled twittering, though some can speak the language of goblins. Pesties generally prefer not to communicate with others (even those of their own race) except through body language and hand signals. It is unknown whether pesties simply cannot or choose not to speak.

Trickery and surprise are the forte of the mite. They avoid direct melee with opponents, preferring to attack from ambush. Often, the first tell-tale signs that mites may be nearby is the plethora of traps, snares, and tripwires encountered. Mites prefer to attack those they feel they can overpower or dispose of quickly. Extremely tough or powerful opponents are ignored and left to pass through unabated or swarmed by a massive number of mites. Though considered unintelligent and stupid by other races, there is a sort of weird cooperation and strategy to mite tactics (that only mites can understand).

A typical mite ambush has the creatures digging narrow tunnels that parallel a dungeon’s corridors. When a foe traverses these corridors, the mites burst from the walls and tunnels and strike quickly with their daggers. Opponents are rarely killed, but any knocked unconscious are relieved of coins, weapons, or any other item of value. If forced into melee, mites seek escape at the first possible opportunity. Mites attack with clubs and a bite in combat, while pesties prefer to utilize hit-and-run tactics to keep opponents off-balance.

Mites make their homes underground in deep, dark dungeons and caverns where they survive by stealing from those unfortunate enough to wander near their lair. A mite lair is often a large central room or cavern from which many small and winding tunnels lead. A mite lair is a filthy place littered with garbage and refuse. Cleanliness and sanitation are virtually unknown in a mite community. Pesties often are found working with or lairing with goblins or (more usually) common mites. The trapmaking skills of the mite complement the pestie’s adeptness at speed and hit-and-run tactics. Mite young are almost never encountered, but a typical lair contains a number of noncombatant young equal to the number of adult mites.t

- Mite, Common: **HD** 1; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** Club (1d4) and bite (1d3) ; **Move** 9; **Save** 17; **AL** C; 
    **CL/XP** 1/15;**Special**:None
- Mite, Pestie: **HD** 1; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** Dagger (1d3); **Move** 15; **Save** 17; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 1/15; 
    **Special**:Surprise on 1-2 on 1d6

### Mogura-Jin (Cannibal Mole Men)

Cannibal Mole-men (Asian)

Mogura-Jin are a race of subterranean humanoids, descended from a group of villagers who resorted to cannibalism during a particularly fierce winter and were cursed by the Gods. They are squat beings, between 4 and 5 feet tall with pale skin, small beady red eyes, no body hair, and nails overgrown to claws. Mogura-Jin are always hungry and need to consume human flesh every so often to remain alive. Like their animal namesake (the mole) they are proficient tunnelers and their preferred method of attacking their victims is to tunnel under them and emerge from the ground in a swarm attack to surprise them.

Mogura-Jin can see perfectly well even in total darkness; however their over-sensitive eyes are easily blinded by bright lights. (*Author: edsan)*

- Mogura-jin: **HD** 2; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d4); **Move** 9 (Burrow 9); **Save** 16; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 2/30; **Special**: Blinded by bright light.

### Mohrg

Mohrgs are the animated corpses of mass murderers or similar villains who died without atoning for their crimes. They resemble zombies, but are far more dangerous, being somewhat more intelligent, much faster, and much stronger a zombie.

Due to a mohrg’s blinding speed, these monsters will always attack first during a combat round unless squared off against an opponent using some sort of magic that increases the character’s own speed of motion (such as *boots of speed*). Mohrgs have two possible methods of attacking. First, the mohrg’s tongue extends five feet, and has a paralyzing effect. A saving throw at -2 is permitted to avoid this effect, but victims failing the saving throw are paralyzed for 1d6 turns. The morgh’s second option in combat is to strike opponents with its fists. When the mohrg hits with its hands, the strike not only causes damage, but allows the mohrg to hold on if the victim fails a saving throw. A character who is so held cannot attack, and if the mohrg hits with its tongue in a subsequent round, the tongue will hit automatically (although the victim is still allowed a saving throw to avoid paralysis). Any held character may break free with a successful saving throw during the character’s attack initiative.

Any character killed by mohrg will rise after 1d4 days as a zombie under the morhg’s control. Thus, mohrgs are often found accompanied by 1d6 zombies.

- Mohrg: **HD** 10; **AC** 0 \[19\]; **Atk** 1 fist (1d8) or tongue (paralysis); **Move** 12; **Save** 5; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 13/2300; **Special**: paralyzing tongue, grabs and holds.

### Mold, Brown

Within 5-ft. of a patch of brown mold, the mold drains body heat from living creatures (other than creatures which use magical cold or have cold breath weapons, such as a white dragon). Damage from the heat drain is 2d8 hit points per round with no saving throw. If fire comes in contact with the mold, the mold grows to cover an area twice its original size, boiling forth into new areas and beginning to suck heat from them in the following round. Growths of brown mold can only be killed by the use of magical cold.

- Brown Mold: **HD** n/a; **AC** n/a; **Atk** none; **Move** 0; **Save** n/a; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: Drains heat.

### Mold, Yellow

Yellow mold is a subterranean fungus; it neither moves nor attacks. However, if it is poked or struck, it may (50% chance) release a cloud of poisonous spores, roughly 10 ft. in diameter. Failing a saving throw against the spores means that the character dies a rather horrible death. Touching yellow mold causes 1d6 points of acid damage. These growths can be destroyed with fire, but are effectively immune to weapons.

- Yellow Mold: **HD** n/a; **AC** n/a; **Atk** 1d6 damage + spore cloud; **Move** 0; **Save** n/a; **CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**: Poisonous spore cloud, killed by fire.

### Mongrelman

Mongrelmen are hideous creatures seemingly pieced together from parts of other monsters as some sort of vile joke or blight on humanity. Though not inherently evil, mongrelmen are shunned from society because of their appearance. They make their homes far from civilization, and those few encountered in settled areas are usually slaves or servants of the local humanoid races. Mongrelmen that must travel among other races take precautions so as not to reveal their true identities, using cloaks, capes, and the like to hide their forms. Mongrelman society is a collection of close-knit tribes, each with its own leader. Mongrelmen never fight against other mongrelmen, preferring to live peaceably with others of their kind, for all mongrelmen know they are shunned by outsiders and must stick together if their race is to survive. Mongrelmen stand about 6 feet tall. The average lifespan of a mongrelman is 35 years. Mongrelmen speak their own guttural language.

Mongrelmen can imitate sounds made by any creature they have previously encountered, including monsters with special vocal attacks. They cannot, however, mimic the special vocal attack powers or damage dealt by such attacks. A successful listen check made by a listener detects the falsehood. 

**Mongrelmen as Characters**

Mongrelman characters enjoy a +1 bonus to strength and constitution scores at character creation, but suffer a -3 penalty to their charisma score. These adjustments cannot increase a starting ability score above 18 or lower a starting ability score below 3. Mongrelmen can see in the dark as well as elves and retain their ability to imitate sounds. Mongrelmen can advance in levels as fighters (up to 6th level, or 7th level with a strength score of 13+) or thieves (up to 8th level, or 9th level with a dexterity of 13+).

**Randomly Generating a Mongrelman**

Mongrelmen are a mixture of many different creatures, and no two mongrelmen ever look alike. The table below can be used to generate the appearance of any given mongrelman.

Roll one time for each of the following areas of a mongrelman: left side of head (includes ear and eye); right side of head (includes ear and eye); torso; right arm; left arm; right leg and left leg.

**20**Missing body part (Use common sense on this one. Obviously, a mongreman cannot
be missing part of its torso.)

- Mongrelman: **HD** 2; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** Fists (1d4) or club (1d6) ; **Move** 12; **Save** 16; **AL** N; 
    **CL/XP** 2/30;**Special**:Sound imitation, surprise on 1-2 on 1d6

### Monstrous Mouth

A bulbous body twelve feet in diameter, resting atop tiny legs, a monstrous mouth is almost entirely a huge, gaping maw equipped with rows upon rows of sharp, pointed teeth. Atop the strange creature’s body, two short eye-stalks allow it to see its prey, even in total darkness. Each of these eye-stalks can discharge a sleep ray, causing potential prey to fall into a deep slumber; this requires a successful attack roll by the monstrous mouth, but no saving throw is permitted. The slumber is identical to that caused by a magic-user’s sleep spell, but affects creatures with any number of hit dice. Each eye-stalk can use a sleep ray only once per day.

Another, even stranger, ability is the monstrous mouth’s capacity to inhale with such force that a specific target up to 30ft away may be sucked into the creature’s toothy maw. A successful attack roll by the monstrous mouth, followed by a failed saving throw on the part of the victim, will result in the victim being “sucked” into the creature’s mouth. Once the victim is sucked in, the monstrous mouth constricts its interior to pin the victim, suffocating him in 1d4+2 rounds. A successful saving throw is required to escape. Each round spent trapped within a monstrous mouth will inflict damage equal to 1d6, +1hp if the victim is wearing leather armor, +2 if the victim is wearing metal armor other than plate mail, and +3 if the victim is wearing plate mail. (*Author: Skathros)*

- Monstrous Mouth: **HD** 6; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** Bite (4d6) or special; **Move** 6; **Save** 11; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: Slumber rays, Inhale.

### Moon Dog

The moon dog is a large wolfhound from the outer planes (believed to have its origins on the plane of Elysium). Moon dogs often enter the Material Plane when chaos has grown to an immeasurable level in an area. Otherwise, they are found in the employ of deities, solars, planetars, and the most powerful devas. 

Moondogs forepaws are prehensile and resemble human hands. Though moon dogs can move on two legs in a bipedal fashion, most do not do so, preferring the speed and grace they gain by moving on all fours. They have grayish-black fur and golden eyes.

A moon dog can produce one of the following effects when it howls or barks.

*Fear:* All evil creatures within 80 feet must make a successful saving throw or be affected as by a *fear* spell.

*Dispel Evil:* This effect works like the spell, and affects one evil creature within 80 feet.

*Dismissal:* This effect forces an extraplanar creature to pass a saving throw or be sent back to its home plane.

The following abilities are always active on the moon dog: *Detect evil, detect magic*, and *detect invisibility*. They can cast mirror image three times per day and *darkness*, *invisibility*, *light* and *obscuring mist* once per day. A moon dog can also *dispel magic* once per day, but doing so forces it back to its plane of origin.

When in shadows, a moon dog can move in such a way as to affect evil creatures within 60 feet as though by a hypnotic pattern. Any lawful creature in the area of the shadow weave will be affected as though by *protection from evil*. The moon dog cannot use its shadow weave and attack, and the moon dog must concentrate to maintain it.

By licking a person’s wounds, a moon dog may use one of the following abilities: *cure disease, cure* *light wounds* or *remove disease.* Each is usable at will by the moon dog, but only once per day per recipient. 

A moon dog can enter the Ethereal Plane, Astral Plane, or Material Plane. 

- Moon Dog: **HD** 9; **AC** -3 \[22\]; **Atk** Bite (1d8); **Move** 18/12 (bipedal); **Save** 7; **AL** L; 
    **CL/XP** 15/2900;**Special**:Bay, shadow weave, spells, +1 or better weapon to hit, immunity to fear, lick, plane shift, magic resistance (30%)

### Mortuary Cyclone

A mortuary cyclone is 5 feet wide at the base, 30 feet wide at the top and about 40 feet tall tornado composed of grave dirt, bone fragments, and body parts all swirling around in its whirlwind form.  A mortuary cyclone emanates an aura of desecration within a 50-foot radius centered on its body. Undead within the area gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saves. Once every 1d4 rounds, a mortuary cyclone can blast forth a mass of bone fragments, debris and negative energy in a 30-foot cone. Creatures caught in the cone take 6d6 points of damage. Creatures that save reduce the damage by half. 

Opponents touching or entering the mortuary cyclone (if the cyclone moves into another creature) might be lifted into the air if they are smaller than the mortuary cyclone. A creature that comes into contact with the whirlwind takes 3d6 points of damage. It must also succeed on a save or be picked up bodily and held suspended in the powerful winds, automatically taking 3d6 points of damage each round thereafter. Creatures trapped in the whirlwind cannot move except to go where the mortuary cyclone carries them or to try to escape the whirlwind. Any living creature slain by a mortuary cyclone’s whirlwind attack or energy drain attack becomes an undead creature in 1d4 rounds. Creatures with less than 3 HD return as a ghoul or ghast; 4-7 HD, a wraith; 8-11 HD, a spectre; and 12+ HD return as a ghost.

- Mortuary Cyclone: **HD** 17; **AC** 0 \[19\]; **Atk** 1 fist (3d6 + level drain); **Move** 16; **Save** 3; 
    **AL** C; **CL/XP** 20/5900;**Special**:50% spell resistance, +2 magic weapons required to hit, create spawn, desecrating aura, whirlwind

### Mosquito, Giant

Giant mosquitoes are 3 feet long and slender, with dark black bodies. Silver scales line their thorax, and like other insects, the giant mosquito is segmented. It has six legs of the same dark color as its body and its single pair of wings is translucent. The giant mosquito possesses a long, slender proboscis, the end of which contains its mouth. Females use this to pierce a living creature’s flesh and drink their blood (1d4 hit points per round for 1d6 rounds).

- Mosquito, Giant: **HD** 4 hp; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1 point + blood drain); **Move** 6/15 (flying); 
    **Save** 13; **AL** N; **CL/XP** B/10;**Special**: Blood drain

### Mothdog

Feathery and brightly fluttering, the mothdog is, as its name suggests, a magical crossbreed of moth and dog. The head has compound eyes and feelers; otherwise the creature looks like a greenish-feathered dog. Mothdogs can be tamed, due to their canine intelligence. However, these creatures are insects that lay eggs and undergo a larval stage. A mothdog can emit a piercing high-pitched sound, primarily as a warning signal; if maintained for more than one round, it may cause disorientation and temporary deafness to all within a radius of 5-ft. per mothdog in the group. Some forest folk, particularly nocturnal humanoids, use mothdogs as guard dogs. The combination of canine scent and bat-like echolocation makes the mothdog a superb tracker; some wilderness villages have been known to employ them as tracking beasts. (*Author: Scott Wylie Roberts, “Myrystyr”)*

- Mothdog: **HD** 2+2; **AC** 8 \[11\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d6); **Move** 18; **Save** 16; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 2/30; **Special**: Moth-scream.

### Mothmere

Little is known about these eerie and malevolent beings. Their appearance in a civilized area is cause for fear and alarm, for they kill humans, sometimes stalking a particular individual, sometimes haunting a specific location such as a crossroads in search of victims. Mothmeres are humanoid in shape, but with great, membranous wings, dark blue-grey skin, and eyes that glow with a faint reddish hue. They have no arms. A mothmere is generally seven feet or so in height, but can be as large as ten feet tall. Mothmeres are most commonly found in the ethereal plane, which may be their natural habitat. They can move into the ethereal plane once per round, becoming immune to any material damage and to all spells other than those with a mental effect. Mothmeres frequently use this ability to enter closed rooms and dismember the inhabitants. A mothmere’s faintly glowing eyes cause fear within 30ft, causing any creature of fewer than 4HD to make a saving throw or flee for 3d12 rounds. Mothmeres can carry 300 lbs. weight while flying, and often pick their victims up to drop from great heights. They also have the ability to control fire at will, as per the pyrotechnics spell. It is unknown why these creatures attack (never eating their prey) or why they seem to haunt areas for periods of time and then suddenly leave. Some claim to have been haunted by these creatures for weeks before being found dead or simply never seen again. Mothmeres typically make temporary lairs in old ruined buildings, hidden caves or mines, or in trees, using them as places to rest during the day and to store trophies from their kills. (*Author: M. Ahmed)*

- Mothmere: **HD** 8; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 2 foot-talons (1d6); **Move** 6 (Fly 24); **Save** 8; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 11/1700; **Special**: Telepathy, mimicry, pyrotechnics, ethereal travel, +1 or better weapon required to hit, magic resistance 30%.

### Muckdweller

The muckdweller is a small, swamp-dwelling bipedal lizard that lives on a diet of carrion, fresh meat, plants, and insects. It has a long tail that allows it to swim rapidly through the water or maintain its balance when standing upright. Muckdwellers sometimes associate with lizardfolk. Muckdwellers stand about 4 feet tall. They speak their own language of croaks and hisses, and a rare few speak the language of black dragons.

By filling its mouth with muddy water, a muckdweller can fire a stream of muddy water in a 10-foot line. A creature hit must succeed on a saving throw or be blinded for 1d2 rounds. A muckdweller can take a move action to refill its mouth with muddy water so it can use its spray again.

- Muckdweller: **HD** 1d6; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** Bite (1d3); **Move** 6/12 (swimming); **Save** 18; **AL** N; 
    **CL/XP** 1/15;**Special**: Blinding spray

### Mudbog

Mudbogs are slow-moving, pudding-like creatures that are brownish in color, resembling nothing more than brackish mud. The average mudbog is roughly 10 feet across and 3 feet deep. Mudbogs dig holes in the swamp and wait for creatures to blunder into their bodies. A mudbog secretes a digestive acid that dissolves organic material (leather armor, wooden clubs, etc.) and deals 1d6 points of damage. Any being that stumbles into a mudbog is considered engulfed and takes 1d6 points of damage from the creature’s acidic nature automatically in the rounds thereafter. 

- Mudbog: **HD** 3; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** Engulf; **Move** 3; **Save** 14; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 3/60; 
    **Special**:Immune to blunt weapons, engulf, acid

### Mudman

A mudman’s natural form is that of a pool of mud about 5 feet in diameter. In this form, they cannot be discerned from normal mud. Mud pools are formed where the run-off from alchemical laboratories mixes with soil. Though not evil, mudmen look with disdain on any who trespass in their mud pools.

When a living creature enters a mud pool, the mudman forms its humanoid shape and attacks until the opponent is slain or leaves the mud pool. A mudman attacks by pummeling a foe with its fists or by hurling globs of mud. Mudmen are bound to the pool where they are formed. 

A mudman attacks by hurling globs of mud at its opponent. These globs deal no damage and have a range of 30 feet. A successful ranged touch attack means the mud glob hits the target and solidifies in the same round. A creature hit by a mud bomb has its movement rate reduced by 3. A creature whose movement is reduced to 0 is stuck on the ground. A stuck creature cannot move without making a successful open doors check. A creature can scrape the mud off, taking one round to scrape it off for every mud bomb that hit them.

A mudman can hurl itself at any creature within 10 feet. If it succeeds on a ranged attack, the mudman engulfs the victim’s head and upper body in mud that instantly solidifies and cuts off the victim’s air. This attack destroys the mudman if its hits; otherwise it reverts to its natural form and must spend one full round reforming. A character that has no air to breathe can hold her breath for 2 rounds per point of Constitution. After this period of time, the character suffocates. The mud can be hit automatically and is destroyed when it takes 6 hit points of damage from a blunt weapon. Each successful attack deals half its damage to the mud and the other half to the engulfed victim. The mud can be pried off by a creature with a successful open doors check.

Mudmen are mindless, and thus immune to mind-influencing effects like charms, suggestions, fear and illusions. *Dispel magic* acts as a *fireball* spell against a mudman, dealing 1d6 points of damage per caster level to all mudmen in a 30-foot radius (no save). *Transmute mud to rock* deals 1d8 points of damage per caster level to all mudmen in the area of effect (save for half).

- Mudman: **HD** 2; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 2 slams (1d4) or mud bomb (see text); **Move** 6; **Save** 16; 
    **AL** N; **CL/XP** 5/240;**Special**:Engulf, mud bomb, +1 or better weapon to hit, mindless, mud pool

### Mummy

Mummies cannot be hit by normal weapons, and even magical weapons cause only half damage. In addition to normal damage, their touch also inflicts a rotting disease which prevents magical healing and causes wounds to heal at one-tenth of the normal rate. A *Cure Disease* spell can increase healing rate to one-half normal, but a *Remove Curse* spell is required to completely lift the mummy’s curse.

Mummified kings, pharaohs, priests, or sorcerers might be considerably more powerful than normal mummies.

- Mummy: **HD** 5+1; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 1 fist (1d12); **Move** 6; **Save** 12; **CL/XP** 7/600; **Special**: Rot, hit only by magic weapons.

### Mummy of the Deep

A mummy of the deep is an undead creature that lairs in the depths of the sea. It is the result of an evil creature that was buried at sea for its sins in life. The wickedness permeating the former life has managed to cling even into unlife and revive the soul as a mummy of the deep. It appears as a rotting humanoid wrapped in seaweed.

On a slam attack, a victim must pass a saving throw or be embraced by the mummy. The mummy presses its lips against an opponent’s and regurgitates sea water into the opponent’s lungs. Each round thereafter, for the next 10 rounds, the victim must make a saving throw or take 1d4 points of damage that round. Three consecutive successful saves means the character has coughed up enough water to shake the effects of this attack and takes no further damage. An affected creature can take no actions other than to defend itself in any round it takes damage from this ability. At 0 or less hit points, the victim falls unconscious. In the next round, he drowns. Holding one’s breath does not prevent drowning because water is already in the lungs. A *remove curse* halts the damage if applied before the creature reaches 0 or less hit points.

At the mere sight of a mummy of the deep, the viewer must succeed on a saving throw or be paralyzed with fear for 1d4 rounds.

Once per day, a mummy of the deep can *part water* or *lower water*.

- Mummy of the Deep: **HD** 6+2; **AC** -1 \[20\]; **Atk** Slam (1d6 plus curse of the deep); 
    **Move** 9/9 (swimming); **Save** 11; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 9/1100;**Special**:Curse of the deep, despair, control water, resistance to fire (50%)

### Murder Crow

Murder crows resemble standard crows except that they stand nearly 4 feet tall with a wingspan of 9 feet. Their tattered feathers are black and carry the stench of death. The eyes of a murder crow are bleak and hollow, showing no signs of emotion or life. Murder crows attack with their jagged beaks and sinister talons. If a murder crow hits an opponent with both claw attacks in the same round, the victim must save or be blinded for 1d4 days or until healed. When killed, a murder crow explodes into a murder of undead ravens.

**Undead Raven Swarm:** HD 7; AC 6\[13\]; Atk Swarm (3d6); Move 18 (flying); Save 9; CL/XP 8/800; Special: Disease, distraction, eye-rake

- Murder Crow: **HD** 8; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d4), bite (1d6); **Move** 6/30 (flying); **Save** 8; 
    **AL** N; **CL/XP** 9/1100;**Special**:Eye-rake, death throes

### Murder-Born

A murder-born appears as a ghostly image with translucent, yet delicate features. Its unholy eyes rage with absolute and thorough evil that reflects its hatred for the living. Spawned of hatred when both mother and child are murdered, the rapacious soul of the unborn sometimes rises as a foul and corrupt spirit. A murder-born’s incorporeal touch does 1d6 points of damage. Twice per day, a murder-born can unleash a child-like wail that causes creatures to be overcome with despair (save resists) and results in a -1 penalty to saving throws for 24 hours. Magic weapons are required to hit the incorporeal murder-born.

- Murder-Born: **HD** 6; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 1 incorporeal touch (1d6); **Move** 15 (flying); **Save** 11; 
    **AL** C; **CL/XP** 8/600;**Special**:Despondent wail, +1 magic weapons to hit

### Mushroom-man

Standing 4 ft. in height, mushroom-men resemble humanoid mushrooms endowed with both arms and legs. Mushroom-men are usually found in natural caves, caverns, and underground passages.

Mushroom-men are initially created by magic. Once given life through magic they reproduce by way of spores. When a mushroom-man dies (0 hit points or less) it releases 1d6 spores which rapidly (within 1d4 rounds) grow into mushroom-men of 1 HD lower than the parent (1 HD mushroom-men do not produce spores upon death). The spores have 2 hit points (before becoming fully formed mushroom-men). (*Author: Skathros)*

- Mushroom-Men: **HD** 1; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** Fist (1d6) or weapon; **Move** 12; **Save** 17; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 1/15; **Special**: Spores.
- Mushroom-Men: **HD** 2; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** Fist (1d6) or weapon; **Move** 12; **Save** 16; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**: Spores.
- Mushroom-Men: **HD** 13 **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** Fist (1d6) or weapon; **Move** 12; **Save** 14; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Spores.

### Naga

“Naga” is the Sanskrit word for dragon or snake. In mythology, the naga are benevolent and very powerful, equivalent to Asian dragons. The nagas portrayed here are more serpentine and less powerful; all have the body of a snake, although the head is not necessarily that of a serpent. All kinds of interesting abilities may be found in “unusual” nagas designed by the Referee, from breathing fire to moving in and out of strange planes of existence.

#### Guardian Naga

The largest and noblest of the naga, guardian nagas are from 20 to 25 feet in length. They do not necessarily have a humanlike head, but some characteristic (a flowing mane of hair, for instance) will immediately set their appearance apart from normal serpents. They can bite or spit with lethal poison, and if they hit with their coils they automatically cause 1d8 points of constriction damage per round thereafter. Guardian nagas cast clerical spells (2/2/1/1). A sample selection of spells for a guardian naga might include: level 1: *Cure light wounds* x2; level 2: *hold person*, *silence 15-foot radius*; level 3: *cure disease*; level 4: *cure serious wounds*.

- Guardian Naga: **HD** 11; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d6 + poison), 1 constrict (1d8), 1 spit (poison); **Move** 18; **Save** 4; **AL** L; **CL/XP** 13/2300; **Special**: Poison, constriction, spells.

#### Hanu-Naga

Hanu-nagas are a predominantly tropical and subtropical form of naga, less magical than the human-headed variety. Rather than a human-headed giant snake, hanu-nagas have a feral monkey head upon a great serpentine body. These nagas lair in jungles and rainforests, haunting forgotten temples and ancient ruins, where many are worshipped by tribes of wild monkeys and/or apes. The most intelligent of hanu-nagas may have followings of tribesmen or cavemen. The stylized, writhing dance of a hanu-naga allows it to exert a mystic control over apes and monkeys within a radius of 300ft. These controlled creatures will act at the naga’s mental command. It is not necessary for the apes to actually see the naga’s dance to fall under its control; indeed, when a hanu-naga begins its dance, simian creatures within one mile (to a maximum of 20 apes) will immediately begin moving at top speed to the dancing naga’s presence. The naga may dance and attack at the same time. The bite of a hanu-naga is poisonous, and if the naga hits with its constricting attack it will inflict automatic damage of 1d6 per round until killed. (*Author: Matt Finch)*

- Hanu-Naga (5 HD): **HD** 5; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d8 + poison) and 1 constrict (1d6); **Move** 12 (In treetops 9); **Save** 12; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 6/400; **Special**: Monkey-summoning dance, poison bite, control simians.
- Hanu-Naga (6 HD): **HD** 6; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d8 + poison) and 1 constrict (1d6); **Move** 12 (In treetops 9); **Save** 11; **CL/XP** 7/600; **Special**: Monkey-summoning dance, poison bite, control simians.

#### Spirit Naga

Spirit nagas are malicious, evil creatures. Their gaze has the effect of a *Charm Person* spell, their bite is poison, and they cast both Magic-User spells (4/2/1) and Cleric spells (2/1). A sample spell selection for a spirit naga might be: Magic-User spells level 1: *Charm Person* x2, *Magic Missile*, *Sleep*; level 2: *Mirror Image*, *Web*; level 3: *Protection from Normal Missiles*. Cleric spells level 1: *Cure Light Wounds* x2; level 2: *Silence 15-foot Radius*. Such nagas are from 10 to 20 feet in length, and have a human head.

- Spirit Naga: **HD** 9; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d3 + poison); **Move** 12; **Save** 6; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 13/2300; **Special**: Poison, charm gaze, spells.

#### Water Naga

Water nagas might be of any alignment. They do not ordinarily have human heads, but like the guardian nagas they will have some physical attributes separating them clearly from normal serpents. In the case of water nagas, this might be the color of the scales or the presence of flowing beard-like fins, perhaps. Water nagas are from 10 to 15-ft. long. Water nagas cast magic-user spells (4/2/1). A sample spell selection for a water naga might be: level 1: *charm person* x2, *magic missile, sleep*; level 2: *mirror image, web*; level 3: *protection from normal missiles*.

- Water Naga: **HD** 7; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d4 + poison); **Move** 12 (Swim 20); **Save** 9; **AL** Any; **CL/XP** 10/1400; **Special**: Poison, spells.

### Nazalor

A nazalor is 7-foot-tall bipedal, stocky, bronze furred hyena with slightly oversized claws and fangs. Its fur is bronze in color with varying shades depending on the creature’s age (young nazalors are brighter in color while an aged nazalor’s coat is dull). Its eyes are usually green or brown. If a nazalor hits an opponent with both claws and its bite in the same round, the opponent must save or be stunned for 1d2 rounds from the ferociousness of the attack.

- Nazalor: **HD** 8; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d8) and bite (1d8); **Move** 6; **Save** 8; 
    **AL** N; **CL/XP** 8/600;**Special**:Stun

### Necrophidius

The necrophidius appears to be a great skeletal snake topped with a human skull. To the dismay of some, it is not undead and therefore cannot be turned or rebuked. The necrophidius is a construct created by a magic-user to serve as a guardian or assassin. A typical necrophidius is 10 feet long.

A necrophidius can entrance opponents by swaying back and forth. Those within 30 feet viewing the dancing snake must succeed on a saving throw (adding a +1 bonus for high wisdom) or be unable to act for 2d4 rounds. Victims are dazed for the duration of the effect and cannot take any action other than defending themselves. 

A living creature bitten by a necrophidius must succeed on a saving throw or be paralyzed for 1d6 minutes.

**Rattler**

A variation of the necrophidius, the rattler is constructed from the skeletal remains of a giant rattlesnake. During the creation process, the tail rattle is left intact and magicked to create a *confusion* effect on those that hear it rattle. The rattler uses the same statistics as the standard necrophidius except it does not have the necrophidius’s dance of death special attack. Instead it gains the special attack detailed below.

By shaking its tail rattle, the creature emits a rattling noise to a range of 30 feet. Those within the area that hear this rattle must succeed on a saving throw or be affected as by a *confusion* spell for 2d4 rounds. 

**Construction**

A necrophidius’ body consists of a human skull and the skeletal remains of a constrictor snake treated with rare oils and powders worth at least 1,000 gp. Creating the body requires the cooperation of a master sculptor and a 10th level magic-user that can cast *charm person* (or *confusion*) and *polymorph*.

- Necrophidius: **HD** 3+3; **AC** 1 \[18\]; **Atk** Bite (1d8 plus paralysis); **Move** 12; **Save** 14; 
    **AL** N; **CL/XP** 5/240;**Special**:Dance of death, paralysis

### Nemorphic Twin

A Nemorphis is a non-corporeal entity that absorbs stray memories and thoughts; they are sometimes attracted toward the sudden reassemblance of memories that takes place when a person is raised from the dead. Once a Nemorphis forms a psychic link to its victim (saving throw negates), it drains an experience level per day, using absorbed memories and feelings to become a ghostly duplicate of its victim, a so-called Nemorphic Twin. During the days when the victim is being drained of life energy, he frequently becomes lost in wistful reveries of past times, alternating with vivid nightmares.

Once the victim descends to 1st Level, the Twin becomes corporeal, usually resembling a more youthful version of the victim. The Nemorphic Twin will track the person down the next day and attempt to slay him, having the same stats, skills and spells possessed by the weakened twin. Whichever combatant is victorious “inherits” the drained experience levels, in a rush of sensations that has a 1 in 4 chance of sending the victor into a coma lasting 1d6 hours. If defeated, a Nemorphic Twin disappears, leaving no trace of its short existence. If the Nemorphic Twin wins, it will be drawn to the places and people it “remembers.” People interacting with the Nemorphic Twin will find it “wrong” in many ways, for it is still mentally inhuman, whatever its guise. (*Author: Sean Wills, aka “Geordie Racer”)*

- Neomorphic Twin: stats depend on circumstances.

### Nereid

Nereids are elemental fey that spend most of their time swimming through the Elemental Plane of Water. Occasionally one finds her way into the Material Plane and takes up temporary residence in lakes, rivers, springs, pools, or inland seas. Many sailors, seafarers, pirates, and other sea-goers have met their ends at the hands of a nereid. Their natural beauty lures men to their doom, for behind the beauty of the honeyed ones lies certain death for any creature that tries to steal a glance or kiss from a nereid.

A nereid can assume the shape of either a male or female humanoid, and almost always assumes a female form unless encountering an all-female party of adventurers. In humanoid form, she can use any of her special attacks and special qualities and can wield weapons and wear armor (though a nereid rarely does so). In her water form, she cannot use any of her special attacks or special qualities, except as noted below. A nereid in water form moves at her swim speed and can flow through cracks, under doors, and through small openings. In this form she retains her damage reduction and AC and gains immunity to poison. A nereid is effectively invisible in water until she assumes humanoid form.

A nereid’s natural form is that of a small pool of water. She can assume a humanoid form at will and usually employs this form when on the Material Plane. Some are arrayed in robes of white or gold, but most appear unclothed. All nereid in humanoid form wear a shawl of white or gold draped over their shoulders.

Nereids shy away from combat and flee at the first sign of conflict if possible. If a nereid encounters only female opponents, she assumes the shape of a handsomely striking male humanoid. A nereid that is attacked can attempt a saving throw. If successful, she takes no damage and assumes her natural watery form and flows away.

A creature of the opposite sex viewing a nereid must make succeed on a saving throw or be instantly smitten and beguiled. This effect is similar to an *charm monster* spell and lasts as long as the nereid is in view. Females viewing a nereid in male form gain a +2 bonus on their saving throw.

Any creature meeting the lips of a nereid must succeed on a saving throw or take 1d4 points of damage as the nereid floods the creature’s lungs with sea water. Each round thereafter, for the next 10 rounds, the victim must make a saving throw or take 1d4 points of damage. Three consecutive successful saves means the character has coughed up enough water to shake the effects of this attack and takes no further damage. An affected creature can take no actions other than to defend itself in any round it takes damage from this ability. At 0 or less hit points, the victim falls unconscious. In the next round, he drowns. Holding one’s breath does not prevent drowning (water is already in the lungs). A *dispel magic, break enchantment, remove curse, heal* spell, or successful DC 20 Heal check halts the damage if applied before the creature reaches 0 or less hit points. Nereids are not prone to giving kisses. An opponent that attempts to force a kiss must succeed on a successful grapple check against the nereid.

Once per round, a nereid can spit a stream of watery poison at an opponent within 20 feet. A successful ranged attack that ignores armor is required to hit. A target hit must succeed on a saving throw or be blinded (as the spell) for 2d6 rounds. A character can take a full round to wash away the poison using water or similar liquid.

A nereid can form a volume of water within 30 feet into the shape of a serpent formed of water. A watery serpent is about 6 feet long. It has the same number of hit points as the nereid who created it, and its AC is 4 \[15\]. Its attacks as the nereid and deals 1d6 points of damage on each successful attack against an opponent.

A nereid need not concentrate to maintain the watery serpent. She can direct it to a new target as a move action if she wishes. At hit points 0, the serpent collapses into normal water. A nereid can only have one such watery serpent in existence at a given time. The watery serpent lasts until destroyed or until the nereid dismisses it or dies.

At will, nereids can *lower water* and *part water*.

The nereid’s shawl contains a portion of her life force. If it is ever destroyed, the nereid to which it belongs immediately and forever dissolves into formless water.

- Nereid: **HD** 4; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** Poison spittle (ranged attack, poison); **Move** 12/15 (swimming); **Save** 13; **AL** N (chaotic tendencies); **CL/XP** 8/800;**Special**:Beguilement, kiss, poison spittle, spells, change shape, magic resistance (40%), transparency, vulnerability

### Netherspark

A netherspark is a 6-foot-tall humanoid whose form is composed of dark matter. Its head is featureless and sports no eyes, ears, nose, or mouth. It wears no clothes, and bands of silver and white crackle and dance in its form. A netherspark radiates an aura of negative energy that does 1 point of damage to any creature in a 10-foot radius. Undead heal 1 point each round. Once every 1d4 rounds, a netherspark can release a burst of negative energy in a 20-foot radius that does 1d8 points of damage (undead heal 1d8 points). A netherspark can release a ray of energy in a 40-foot line that drains 1 level (save resists).

- Netherspark: **HD** 10; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 2 slams (1d6); **Move** 12/15 (swimming); **Save** 5; **AL** N; 
    **CL/XP** 13/2300;**Special**:Negative energy ray, negative energy burst

### Night Hag

Night hags come from beyond the material plane: perhaps from the realms of dream, perhaps from the demonic pits of the underworlds. These creatures prey upon the souls of those who are evil/chaotic: they can cause enchanted sleep once against such individuals (saving throw, affects up to 12<sup>th</sup> level), or visit the victim’s dreams nightly (no saving throw) to leech away a point of constitution per night until the attribute reaches 0 and the hag can steal away the soul. In combat, night hags can magically weaken an opponent to half normal strength (saving throw) three times per day; additionally, they can use a spell that automatically inflicts 2d8 points of damage against a single opponent. Both of these abilities have a range of 100ft. A hag can also also become ethereal and incorporeal at will, summon a demon ally once per day (with only a 50% chance of success), and cannot be hit by weapons with a magical bonus of +2 or less. They are highly resistant to magic, as well.

- Night Hag: **HD** 8; **AC** 8 \[11\]; **Atk** 1 bite (2d6); **Move** 10; **Save** 8; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 12/2000; **Special**: Magic resistance (65%), +2 or better magic weapon to hit, magical abilities.

### Nightmare

Nightmares are the steeds of night hags and other demons; black horses with flaming hoofs and mane. Their breath is a cloud of brimstone smoke, which causes any nearby opponent to attack at –2 (saving throw applies). These horrible creatures can become incorporeal and travel between the planes of existence bearing their evil/chaotic riders.

- Nightmare: **HD** 7; **AC** –4 \[23\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d8), 2 hoofs (2d6); **Move** 18 (Fly 35); **Save** 9; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 10/1400; **Special**: Breathe smoke, ride between planes/realities.

### Nightshade

A nightshade is a being of pure negative energy formed by the will of the undead. It can assume many shapes by sheer force of will although in its relaxed state it appears as a sludge or ooze-shaped creature composed of withering darkness. At will, a nightshade can cast darkness (15-ft. radius) and detect magic. Three times per day, it can use haste, hold monster and invisibility. Once per day, it can cast cone of cold, finger of death and monster summoning IV. Anyone staring into the swirling negativity of a nightshade’s being must save or flee in fear (as per the spell of the same name). The touch of a nightshade draws the heat from beings, dealing an additional 2d6 points of damage.

- Nightshade: **HD** 14; **AC** 0 \[19\]; **Atk** 2 claws (2d8 + 2d6 cold); **Move** 6; **Save** 3; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 16/3,200; **Special**: Cold, gaze attack, magical powers.

### Nilbog

The nilbog is a goblin afflicted with a strange space-time reversal disease known as nilbogism. The disease appears to occur when overly heavy use of magic strains the fabric of the space-time continuum and leads to some very strange localized events. The disease only affects goblins and is not transmitted by them. In appearance, nilbogs are indistinguishable from goblins.

A nilbog constantly emanates an aura of *confusion* in a 20-foot-radius. A creature in the area must succeed on a saving throw or be affected.

When struck by any attack that would normally damage it, the nilbog actually gains hit points equal to the damage the attack would have otherwise dealt. A nilbog gains any extra hit points above its normal total as temporary hit points, though it can never have more than twice its normal hit points.

The nilbog can only be damaged through the use of curative magic and effects (*cure light wounds* and healing potions, for instance). Curative magic deals damage equal to the amount it would normally heal.

- Nilbog: **HD** 1d6; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 1 mace (1d6) or javelin (1d4); **Move** 9; **Save** 18; **AL** C; 
    **CL/XP** 1/15;**Special**:Spatio-temporal reversal, damage reversal 

### Niln (Vapor Horror)

Nilns are large, amorphous clouds of nearly transparent vapor. Small water droplets dance and play around their form and occasionally drop to the ground. Three large sapphire droplets function as eyes. When manipulating objects or attacking, nilns form wispy and vaporous tendrils that coat everything in water and put out open flames. Once per day, the niln can create a muggy cloud around it that spreads to fill a 20-foot radius. This moving fog fills a victim’s lungs with water as if he is drowning (2d6 damage, save resists).

- Niln: **HD** 5; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 1 slam (1d6); **Move** 24 (flying); **Save** 12; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 5/240; 
    **Special**:Drench, drowning fog

### Nixie

Nixies are weak water fey creatures. One in ten of them has the power to cast a powerful *charm person* (-2 penalty to saving throw) that causes the victim to walk into the water and join the nixies as their slave for a year. Casting *dispel magic* against the curse has only a 75% chance of success, and once the victim is actually in the water the chance drops to 25%. Nixies are ordinarily friendly, but they are highly capricious.

- Nixie: **HD** 1d4hp; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 1 weapon (1d6); **Move** 6 (Swim 12); **Save** 18; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 1/15; **Special**: Charm.

### Nuckalavee

A nuckalavee is a large skinless warhorse with a rider of similar make-up, though closer inspection reveals the rider is actually part of the monster itself, growing straight out of the horse’s back. The monster’s internal organs, veins that carry its blackened blood, and corded muscles are all visible. Its body is covered with a thin layer of putrid reddish mucus. The sight of a nuckalavee incites fear in creatures within 30 feet that see it (as per the spell, save resists). Nuckalavee relish combat and attack with a combination of weapon, bite and hoof. Once every four rounds, the nuckalavee can breathe a cloud of noxious gas from its horse head that liquefies organs of those around it (6d6 damage, save for half).

- Nuckalavee: **HD** 8; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 2 hooves (1d6), bite (1d6) and 1 weapon (2d8); **Move** 18; 
    **Save** 8; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 9/1100;**Special**:Breath weapon, fearful presence

### Nykoul

Nykoul are undead hill giant shamans, driven to continue plaguing the world by dark powers from beyond this world. In addition to being able to cast spells as a 5th level Cleric, Nykoul possess a disorienting gaze attack (as the spell Confusion) that they may use twice per day. One in three Nykoul commands an army of 1-12 Giant Rats. (*Author: Andrew Trent, “the Venomous Pao”)*

- Nykoul: **HD** 9; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 1 Weapon (2d12); **Move** 9; **Save** 6; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 11/1700; **Special**: Spells, Undead Immunities, Confusion.

### Nymph

Nymphs inhabit the wild and untrammeled places of the earth, spots of beauty and calm. Anyone seeing a nymph naked must make a saving throw or die (or sometimes be transformed into an animal). Even looking upon a nymph causes permanent blindness (saving throw). Nymphs are not powerful in and of themselves, but harming a nymph almost always brings down vengeance of some sort from the gods.

- Nymph: **HD** 3; **AC** 9 \[10\]; **Atk** none; **Move** 12; **Save** 14; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Sight causes blindness or death.

### Oakman

An oakman stands just less than 4 feet tall. Its skin is brownish-green and as tough as tree bark, and he has unkempt green hair. Its eyes are either green or brown and its nose is slightly large and bulbous.  Any oaken staff or club wielded by an oakman is considered a +1 weapon. An oakman is usually bound to a single enormous oak that he can never stray more than 1 mile from. He uses his tree stride ability to travel between trees to roam his territory. An oakman likes to sit in his tree and insult passers-by.

- Oakman: **HD** 3; **AC** 8 \[11\]; **Atk** +1 staff (1d6+1); **Move** 6/9 (climbing); **Save** 14; **AL** C; 
    **CL/XP** 3/60;**Special**:Magic weapon, tree stride

### Oblivion Wraith

An oblivion wraith appears very much like a wraith, and shares the same immunity to non-magic weapons and cold, but it is not actually undead, being a creature of the void rather than undeath. An oblivion wraith’s touch shreds the raw existence of the creature hit, dealing 3d6 points of damage and also permanently draining one point from the target’s highest attribute for every natural 5 or 6 rolled on the damage dice. For example, a damage roll of 6, 3, and 5 on 3d6 deals 14 damage and drains 2 points from the target’s highest attribute. In addition, if a creature brings any nonliving object (such as a swung weapon) into contact with an oblivion wraith, the object is irrevocably disintegrated (magical objects receive a saving throw). Oddly, oblivion wraiths are unable to actively disintegrate objects by touching them. (*Author: Guy Fullerton)*

- Oblivion Wraith: **HD** 12; **AC** 1 \[18\]; **Atk** 1 touch (3d6 + attribute drain); **Move** 15 (Fly 30); **Save** 3; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 15/2900; **Special**: Drain attributes, immune to non-magical weapons, disintegrates objects.

### Obsidian Minotaur

An obsidian minotaur stands 12 feet tall and weighs roughly 2,000 pounds. It appears to be a minotaur carved from a single block of obsidian and then animated via some eldritch ritual. Small pinpoints of blue light can be seen in its eyes. 

The obsidian minotaur is often employed by spellcasters as a guardian or assassin. As a guardian, the obsidian minotaur activates when trespassers enter an area it is programmed to protect. As an assassin, it actively hunts down the targeted victim.

Once every 1d4+1 rounds, an obsidian minotaur can expel a cloud of gas directly in front of it. The cloud fills a 10-foot cube and lasts for 1 round before dispersing. Any creature in the area must succeed on a saving throw or be slowed (as the *slow* spell).

The claws of an obsidian minotaur deal 1d6 points of burning damage each time they hit. A creature hit must succeed on a saving throw or take an additional 1d6 points of fire damage for 1d4+1 rounds as clothes ignite and armor becomes searing hot.

An obsidian minotaur is immune to most spells. Certain spells and effects function differently against the creature as noted below.

A *transmute rock to mud* spell slows it (as the *slow* spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw, while *transmute mud to rock* heals all of its hit points. 

A *stone to flesh* spell does not actually change the obsidian minotaur’s structure but negates its immunity to magic for 1 full round. 

**Construction**

An obsidian minotaur is sculpted from 2,500 pounds of black obsidian worth at least 3,000 gp. Assembling the body requires a 17th level magic-user and a master sculptor. The magic-user must be able to cast fireball and wish.

- Obsidian Minotaur: **HD** 12; **AC** -2 \[21\]; **Atk** 2 claws (2d8 plus 1d6 fire), breath weapon; 
    **Move** 9; **Save** 3; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 16/3200;**Special**:Breath weapon, burn, immune to magic

### Ochre Jelly

Ochre jellies are amorphous oozes that damage opponents with their acidic surface. They dissolve any adventurers they kill, making a raise dead spell impossible. The creature divides if struck with lightning (each with half the monster’s existing hit points).

- Ochre Jelly: **HD** 6; **AC** 8 \[11\]; **Atk** 1 acid-laden strike (3d4); **Move** 3; **Save** 11; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 6/400; **Special**: Lightning divides creature.

### Octopus, Giant

After a giant octopus hits with a tentacle, it does 1d6 points of damage per round, automatically, instead of the initial 1d3. Also, there is a 25% chance that the tentacle “hit” pinions one of the victim’s limbs (roll randomly for left/right arms and legs to see which is immobilized). A giant octopus can jet water out to achieve a movement rate of up to 27, and can also release a huge cloud of ink to obscure its location. Some giant octopi might be able to move onto land for short periods of time. Note: it is occasionally possible to encounter giant octopi that are highly intelligent rather than being no more than a freakishly large animal. These intelligent giant octopi will be followers of Chaos rather than being Neutrally–aligned.

- Giant Octopus: **HD** 4; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 8 tentacles (1d3); **Move** 3 (Swim 19); **Save** 13; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 6/400; **Special**: Jet, ink, constriction.

### Oculaktis

These spherical monstrosities are essentially gigantic eyeballs that drift through space in some of the more bizarre dimensions of existence. They are used as floating mounts by beings wild and weird. They may transmit their superhuman visual information to riders if desired, as well as make terrifying gaze attacks once per combat round. The concentrated gaze of an oculaktis actually transmits a powerful beam that can cause magnificent explosions, incinerate solid stone, or melt men to puddles of steaming jelly. The heat beam has a range of 100ft and the first time it is used it inflicts 6d6 points of damage (saving throw for half damage) to its target. Thereafter, unless the oculaktis has an hour or more to “recharge,” the beam only inflicts 3d6 points of damage (save for half). The oculaktis must make a successful to-hit roll with the heat beam. (*Author: Random)*

- Oculaktis: **HD** 7; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** Gaze (6d6 or 3d6); **Move** (Fly 15); **Save** 11; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 10/1400; **Special**: Heat ray (save for half damage).

### Ogres

#### Ogre

Ogres are normally quite stupid, but more intelligent versions might be encountered here and there.

- Ogre: **HD** 4+1; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 1 weapon (1d10+1); **Move** 9; **Save** 13; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: None.

#### Ogre, Swamp

Swamp Ogres are larger, semi-aquatic cousins of standard ogres. They range in color from moldy green to burnt yellowish-brown, and they have huge heads that protrude forward from their enormous, hunched shoulders. Their great arms are able to rotate around completely, allowing them to easily reach anywhere on their backs and shoulders. Swamp Ogres are often covered in moss, swamp grass, and mud, which facilitates their favorite mode of Attacks: Surprise. Swamp Ogres sit or lie down in the muck (depending on depth) so that just their great shoulder hump protrudes above the mire; when still, they need to breathe only once each hour. While in this position, a Swamp Ogre waits until someone or something sets foot upon its shoulders, whereupon its arms move with lightning speed to grab its victim and pull it down into the mire to be eaten. If the Swamp Ogre hits with both hands, it drags the opponent completely below the mire to drown in 4-6 rounds. If the Swamp Ogre hits with only one hand, it drags the opponent under on the following round, unless 8 points of damage is dealt to its hand or it is otherwise forced it to loosen its grip. Once its opponent is underneath the mire, the Swamp Ogre uses its conventional claw and bite attacks on the unfortunate victim. If a Swamp Ogre scores a natural 20 with its bite attack against a man-size or smaller opponent, it swallows that opponent whole. A swallowed opponent suffers 1d8 damage each round from stomach acid, can’t attack with anything larger than a dagger, and ultimately suffocates in 2d4 rounds. (*Author: Sean Stone)*

- Swamp Ogre: **HD** 6+1; **AC** 4(15); **Atk** 2 grabs (submerge opponent), or 2 claws (1d6 each) and bite (2d6); **Move** 6 (Swim 12); **Save** 11; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: Surprise opponents on a 1-5 when hiding in swamp, and swallow whole with bite on a natural 20.

#### Ogre, Tusken

Tusken ogres are a race of ogres mid-way between the normal, feral ogre and the magically potent ogre mage. These ogres have a only a pale bluish tint to their skin, and powerful tusks protruding from their mouths. They are somewhat more intelligent than normal ogres, and are often found in the service of an ogre mage. Tusken ogres that are not minions of an ogre mage, encountered in the wild, often inhabit crude but human-like residences. They dress in silk garments taken from victims or merchants, and usually fight with polearms or outsized swords. They are inveterate slavers, and their lairs will often contain human prisoners, especially women. A tusken ogre has one magical ability, which is to create a single mirror image of itself at the beginning of a battle. As with the spell mirror image, the illusory double will disappear when it is hit. Female tusken ogres are encountered only rarely. Asian and European varieties of the tusken ogre are actually quite similar, although the European type would likely not be dressed in silk but in whatever finery might be available. (*Author: Matt Finch)*

- Tusken Ogre: **HD** 5; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 1 weapon (1d10+1); **Move** 12; **Save** 12; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Single mirror image.

#### Ogre Mage

The ogre mage is an ogre with magic powers, based on Japanese legend. An ogre mage can fly, turn invisible (per the spell), create a

10-foot-radius circle of magical darkness, change into human form, cast *Sleep* and *Charm Person* once per day, and cast a *Cone of Frost*

with a range of 60 feet to a base of 30 feet, causing 8d6 damage to any caught within (saving throw applies). Western folklore also contains many examples of shape-shifting, magical ogres (the most famous example being the one in *Puss-in-Boots*), so there might be many different interpretations of magical ogres whether or not they are called“ogre mage.”

- Ogre Mage: **HD** 5+4; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 1 weapon (1d12); **Move** 12 (Fly 18); **Save** 12; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 7/600; **Special**: Magic use, regenerate 1hp/round.

### Ogren

Ogrens are 6- to 8-foot-tall stocky humanoids with hairy hides of dark brown, yellowish-brown, or gray. Their eyes are generally gray or black, though some do have green or blue eyes. Hair color ranges from brown or black to dark red or gray. Most ogren have long hair and rarely if ever sport facial hair. The typical ogren lives to 100 years of age. Ogrens are a mix of a male ogre and a female hobgoblin.

- Ogren: **HD** 2; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 1 weapon (1d8); **Move** 9; **Save** 16; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 2/30; 
    **Special**:None

### Ogrillon

Ogrillons are a fierce half-ogre race born of a union between a female orc and a male ogre. They tend to act like ogres, but they are far more violent and aggressive than their larger kin. Ogrillons are usually only slightly taller than orcs, with features that strongly favor their orc parent, so much so that most ogrillons are indiscernible from normal orcs. About 10% of ogrillons resemble their ogre parent. Ogrillon’s skin is covered in closely fitting bony plates and nodes akin to an alligator.

Ogrillons love nothing more than combat. They are a race so inborn to be warriors that they seem almost depressed and dejected when they are not involved in melee. They only time an ogrillon laughs is when it is the center of a whirlwind of melee and covered in its opponent’s blood. Ogrillons do not care for armor or weapons and in fact carry very little gear at all. They do, however, like gold pieces and usually keep a few in a filthy pouch with other shiny trinkets as lucky charms. 

Ogrillons speak orc and ogre, and about 10% are intelligent enough to have learned the common tongue.

Ogrillons disdain the use of armor, relying solely on their natural armor to protect them. They also disdain the use of weapons, preferring to leap headlong into a fray with fists swinging madly. Ogrillons are considered to be armed even when unarmed (i.e., they do not provoke attacks of opportunity from armed opponents when attacking them and can themselves still make an attack of opportunity against an opponent that attacks unarmed). Additionally, they always deal lethal damage rather than nonlethal damage when fighting unarmed.

- Ogrillon: **HD** 2; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 2 strikes (1d4+1); **Move** 12; **Save** 16; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 2/30; 
    **Special**: Reinforced fists

### Oil Shark

Oil sharks are, on average, about 20 feet long, though they can reach lengths of 40 feet or more. Oil sharks resembles standard sharks with blackish-blue, metallic scales and dull gray eyes. They are blind and rely completely upon their “sonar” to hunt their prey. They are immune to fire.

- Oil Shark: **HD** 9; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d8+4); **Move** 24 (swimming); **Save** 6; **AL** N; 
    **CL/XP** 9/1100;**Special**:immune to fire

### Oktomon

Oktomon appear rather like man-sized octopi, but they are actually clever tool and weapon-using “humanoids.” They generally live underwater, either fresh or salt, but are fully amphibious and can breathe on land as well as underwater. Oktomon walk on 4 of their eight legs and use the other 4 as arms. In combat, Oktomon use various combinations of four weapons and shields. They do not typically use pulled bows, but may occasionally make use of crossbows. Due to their wide-set eyes and multiple arms, it is virtually impossible to flank an Oktomon or successfully attack one “from behind.” Oktomon are attracted to shiny objects and often carry a number of items of jewelry with them as prized possessions. Oktomon are renowned for their mechanical abilities, and an Oktomon lair is typically a very dangerously trapped location. Tales of magic-using Oktomon are often told, but have yet to be verified. Depending on the source, it is also reported that Oktomon are either outright hostile towards or firmly allied with Sea Hags. It is possible, of course, that different groups of Oktomon may have different allegiances. (*Author: Andrew Trent)*

- Oktomon: **HD** 3; **AC** without shields 6 \[13\]; **Atk** Up to 4 weapons (damage by weapon type); **Move** 12 (Swim 18); **Save** 14; **AL** usually C; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: None.

### Old Crawler

An “old crawler” is a withered human hand severed at the wrist, black and mummified in appearance. Many think they may originate from the leftovers of a lich. Old crawlers attack by sneaking up on a character and grabbing his or her foot; or they drop from a higher place onto the head, face or shoulder of the poor adventurer. The grip of an old crawler can only be broken with a roll of 1 on a d4 (1-2 if the character has magical or special strength). Any area squeezed by an old crawler is subject to gangrenous rotting, and continues to incur damage until the grip is broken. Once latched on, the old crawler remains so until destroyed or pried loose. Some old crawlers have magical rings that can still cast attacks. While fire would be the most obvious harm to the hand, it poses quite a threat if attached to a victim. Bashing attacks are the most effective. The old crawler can “flee” with a scrambling move when needed at double its normal crawling rate. Note that Old crawlers are extremely resistant to many attacks due to magically improved saving throws left over from their strange origins (included in stats). (*Author: Old Crawler)*

- Old Crawler: **HD** 2; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 1 rotting grip (1d8); **Move** 6 (Scramble 12); **Save** 11; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**: Possible spell casting, good saving throws, continuous damage.

### Olive Slime

Olive slime is a plantlike growth found in dark, damp underground areas. It is sticky, wet, and olive drab in color. It clings to walls, ceilings, and floors and consumes any organic matter it contacts. Olive slime can detect prey by vibration to a range of 30 feet and drops from ceilings and walls when it detects movement underneath it.

When a patch of olive slime drops and attaches to a foe (the host), it secretes a numbing poison that makes its presence go unnoticed. A creature viewing the host can successfully notice the olive slime on a roll of 1 on 1d6. Within 5 feet of the host, the olive slime is easily noticed.

An olive slime that has attached itself affects the thinking pattern of its host so the host’s main concern becomes how to feed and protect the olive slime (including keeping the creature hidden from any adventuring companions). This effect is similar to a *charm monster* spell. If a creature attempts to remove the olive slime from the host, the host either attacks that creature or attempts to flee the area. The only way to successfully break the brain link is to destroy the olive slime, destroy the host, or remove the olive slime from the host.

A single patch of olive slime deals 1d6 points of constitution damage each day as it devours flesh, replacing skin and muscle tissue. Additionally, the host must double its normal food intake each day or sustain an additional 1 point of constitution damage each day. On days the host does not eat twice its normal food intake it does not naturally heal any damage (including ability damage). At constitution 0, the host dies and its body transforms into a slime zombie. (See the slime zombie below.)

Olive slime can be burned, frozen, or cut away (dealing an equal amount of damage to the host as well). Anything that deals acid, cold or fire damage, or a *cure disease* spell destroys a patch of olive slime. 

**Slime Zombie**

**Hit Dice:** 3**Armor Class:** 3 \[16\]**Attack:** Slam (1d6 plus infestation)
**Saving Throw:** 14**Special:** Infestation, death throes, mind link, telepathic bond, immunity to electricity**Move:** 9**Alignment:** Neutrality**Challenge Level/XP:** 6/400

Slime zombies (or olive slime creatures) are created when a living creature is slain by a patch of olive slime (see that entry). The slime zombie’s sole purpose for existence is to capture or kill new prey for its master (i.e., the olive slime that created it).

A slime zombie resembles a humanoid blob, olive drab in color. The creature bears no distinguishing marks or facial features. It can speak to others of its kind through telepathy, but otherwise makes no sound or noise.

Any creature hit by the slime zombie’s attack must succeed on a saving throw or be infested with olive slime. This infestation works as described in the olive slime entry.

When a slime zombie is brought to 0 hit points, its structure collapses and it transforms in a single round as a pool of olive slime (see that entry in this book).

A slime zombie is linked symbiotically with the patch of olive slime that created it. This link has a maximum range of 200 miles. Both the slime zombie and olive slime must be on the same plane of existence.

Olive slime zombies have a telepathic bond with each other to a range of 100 feet if they were created by the same olive slime. This bond allows them rudimentary communication with one another.

### Omgoth

Omgoths were once holy men who, through betrayal of their faith, now suffer from a curse that has given them a rotting, ghoulish appearance. Indeed, they look so much like ghouls that they are often mistaken for one. Their bodies are in always in a continuous state of decay and they must regularly feed on the living to replenish their lost flesh or the curse will consume them. Omgoths exude an aura of corruption that causes healing magics employed in their presence to damage the intended recipient instead of healing; be they from spells, potions or magical items. Though omgoths may be found in the company of undead creatures, they are not themselves undead and cannot be turned. (*Author: The Lizard of Oz)*

- Omgoth: **HD** 4; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d6); **Move** 9; **Save** 13; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Corruption.

### Oozes

#### Crystal Ooze

The crystal ooze is an aquatic variety of the gray ooze. It is semitransparent and clear, almost impossible to see in the water and looks like nothing more than a puddle of water. The crystal ooze can grow to a length of up to 8 feet and a thickness of about 6 inches.

A crystal ooze secretes a digestive acid that quickly dissolves organic material, but not metal. Half of the damage from a melee hit is from this acid. Non-metal armor or clothing dissolves and becomes useless immediately unless its wearer succeeds on a saving throw. A wooden weapon that strikes a crystal ooze also dissolves immediately unless the wielder succeeds on a saving throw. 

In addition to its digestive acid, a crystal ooze secretes a paralytic slime. A target hit by a crystal ooze’s strike must succeed on a saving throw or be paralyzed for 3d6 rounds. 

Crystal oozes can survive out of the water for 5 hours. 

- Crystal Ooze: **HD** 4; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** Strike (2d6 plus paralysis); **Move** 3/6 (swimming); **Save** 13; **AL** N; 
    **CL/XP** 6/400;**Special**:Acid, paralysis, immune to acid, cold and fire, transparent, water dependent

#### Entropic Ooze

An entropic ooze is an amorphous mass of black protoplasm that covers an area of 15 feet or more. It resembles a black pudding, for which it is often mistaken. Entropic oozes devour the souls of creatures they slay. Creatures that lose their souls in such a way cannot be returned to life until the entropic ooze containing the soul is slain. Living creatures hit by an entropic ooze lose two levels unless they save to resist the level drain. 

- Entropic Ooze: **HD** 10; **AC** 8 \[11\]; **Atk** 1 pseudopod (2d6 + level drain); **Move** 6; **Save** 5; **AL** N; 
    **CL/XP** 11/1700;**Special**:25% magic resistant, devour soul

#### Entropic Ooze (Dark Matter)

Dark matter entropic oozes are amorphous masses of black protoplasm that cover areas of 25 feet or more. They are the larger cousins of regular entropic oozes. Dark matter entropic oozes devour the souls of creatures they slay. Creatures that lose their souls in such a way cannot be returned to life until the entropic ooze containing the soul is slain. Living creatures hit by an entropic ooze lose three levels unless they save to resist the level drain. 

- Entropic Ooze: **HD** 20; **AC** 8 \[11\]; **Atk** 1 pseudopod (2d8 + level drain); **Move** 6; **Save** 3; **AL** N; 
    **CL/XP** 23/1700;**Special**:25% magic resistant, devour soul

#### Glacial Ooze

A glacial ooze is an enormous jelly found in arctic climates. This creature appears as translucent bluish-white icy sludge about 10 feet on each side (though larger specimens have been encountered). This ooze is conjectured to be a relative of the gelatinous cube. Glacial oozes absorb all bodily fluids and liquids from a corpse, leaving behind a frozen and rotting husk. They can form a pseudopod to pummel foes, and their freezing touch deals 1d6 damage. If a glacial ooze strikes a foe, it can decide on its next attack to instead engulf that opponent (save avoids). Engulfed enemies take 1d6 points of cold damage until freed.

- Glacial Ooze: **HD** 5; **AC** 8 \[11\]; **Atk** 1 slam (2d6); **Move** 4/12 (swim); **Save** 12; **AL** N; 
    **CL/XP** 6/400;**Special**:cold, engulf, transparent, immune to cold and blunt weapons

#### Magma Ooze

A magma ooze appears to be a pool of bubbling and churning molten rock. They are almost always found in or near volcanoes and other warm or hot places. Magma oozes do not approach water and are never found near such sources. Magma oozes can grow to a length of 10 feet, with a thickness of about 6 inches. A magma ooze can climbs walls and move across ceilings.

The magma ooze is formed of molten rock. Any melee hit deals 2d6 points of burning damage. The damage continues for 1d3 rounds, but deals only 1d6 points of damage per round during this time.

Slashing and piercing weapons deal no damage to a magma ooze. Instead, they split the creature into two identical oozes, each with half of the original’s current hit points (round down). A magma ooze with 10 hit points or less cannot be further split.

- Magma Ooze: **HD** 7; **AC** 8 \[11\]; **Atk** Strike (2d6 plus 2d6 fire); **Move** 6; **Save** 9; **AL** N; 
    **CL/XP** 8/800;**Special**:Lava, immune to fire, double damage from cold, split

#### Mercury Ooze

A mercury ooze resembles a swirling thick pool of silvery-white mercury about 8 feet long and 6 inches thick. It can compress its body to a thickness of 1 inch to slip into cracks and crevices.

A creature hit by a mercury ooze has 1 point of constitution and 1 point of dexterity permanently drained from them unless they pass a saving throw. One week after suffering the drain, the opponent must succeed on a saving throw or be affected as if by an *insanity* spell. The effects can be removed by the successful casting of a *wish* spell.

- Mercury Ooze: **HD** 5; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** Strike (2d4 plus mercury poisoning); **Move** 12/9 (swimming); 
    **Save** 12; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 6/400;**Special**:Mercury poisoning

#### Metallic Ooze (Hoard Ooze)

A metallic ooze appears as a 9-foot blob of protoplasm of varying hue and color. Its form is coarse and rough giving it the appearance of piles of coins. A metallic ooze can flatten its body in order to squeeze through spaces and cracks. Metallic oozes come in a variety of sizes and colors: gold, silver, platinum, copper, brass, or bronze. They form pseudopods to attack foes. If a hoard ooze hits a creature, it can decide to engulf that opponent in the next round. Engulfed creatures are trapped inside its body, where the ooze’s acid desolves organic matter (1d6 points of damage each round). If burned, the ooze emits a cloud of vapor that burns the eyes and lungs of creatures within 10 feet (2d6 damage, save for half). 

- Metallic Ooze: **HD** 7; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 1 slam (1d8); **Move** 6/3 (climbing); **Save** 9; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 8/800; 
    **Special**:Acid, irritating fumes, immune to blunt weapons

#### Undead Ooze

This creature appears as a large, undulating mass of black goo from which rotted and broken bones protrude.

When an ooze moves across the grave of a restless and evil soul, a transformation takes place. The malevolent spirit, still tied to the rotting flesh consumed by the ooze, melds with the ooze. The result is a creature filled with hatred of the living and an intelligence and cunningness not normally known among its kind. The resulting undead ooze appears as a large, undulating mass of black goo from which rotted and broken bones protrude.

The undead ooze has an advantage over any other ooze: intelligence. It uses this new gift to its fullest in combat by attacking from surprise or by stalking its prey and attacking when the opportunity presents itself. The undead ooze attacks by slamming its body into its prey. It usually engulfs its foes or expels its skeleton allies to contend with its enemies. Undead oozes are undead and can be turned by clerics.

Although it moves slowly, an undead ooze can mow down creatures by moving over them. It cannot make a strike during a round in which it engulfs a creature. Targets who do not attempt to attack the ooze can attempt a saving throw to avoid being engulfed. An engulfed creature automatically takes strike damage each round.

Each round, in place of moving or striking, an undead ooze can expel 1d6 skeletons from its mass. Skeletons can act in the round they are expelled. Slain skeletons are engulfed by the undead ooze and can be reanimated and expelled again in 1 hour. 

- Undead Ooze: **HD** 6; **AC** 9 \[10\]; **Atk** Strike (2d4 plus 1d6 cold); **Move** 9/9 (climbing); **Save** 11; **AL** C; 
    **CL/XP** 8/800;**Special**:Engulf, skeletons

#### Vampiric Ooze

Some think the vampiric ooze was created by a lich using ancient and forbidden magic. Others believe the vampiric ooze was formed when an ochre jelly slew a vampire and absorbed it. Whatever the monster’s origins, it looks like a thick, bubbling pool of mustard yellow muck. It can alter its shape so as to appear up to 12 feet long and 6 inches thick; it can also compress its body to slip through cracks as small as 1 inch wide. It spends its time slithering along floors, walls, and ceilings, or if above ground, hunting its prey at night.

The ooze’s attacks drain one level unless the victim of the attack passes a saving throw. Any humanoid slain by a vampiric ooze becomes a zombie in 1d4 rounds. Spawn are under the command of the vampiric ooze that created them and remain enslaved until its death. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life. For each such level drained, the vampiric ooze gains 1 Hit Dice.

Cold and electricity deal no damage to a vampiric ooze. Instead they cause the monster to split into two identical oozes, each with half of the original’s current hit points (round down). A vampiric ooze with 10 hit points or less cannot be further split. Exposing a vampiric ooze to direct sunlight destroys it utterly if it cannot escape in one round.

- Vampiric Ooze: **HD** 8; **AC** 8 \[11\]; **Atk** Strike (2d4 plus level drain); **Move** 6/6 (climbing); **Save** 8; **AL** C; 
    **CL/XP** 10/1400;**Special**:Level drain, create spawn, split, sunlight vulnerability

### Ophidian

Ophidians are an ancient race of snake-beings, with scaly human arms and a somewhat human-looking head. They are denizens of hot climates, deserts and jungles both, often found in forgotten cities or temples from the days when their race held greater sway in the world. Anyone bitten by an ophidian and failing a saving throw will, within 1d4 weeks, produce ophidian children and die in the process. It is in this manner that ophidians reproduce; they are otherwise asexual. The deadly “pregnancy” can be ended by a cure disease spell or similar magics. Lesser, or “sterile,” ophidians (a non-breeding caste) are sometimes found – these have no effective bite.

- Sterile (Lesser) Ophidian: HD3; **AC** 4 \[15\] or 3\[16\] with shield; Atk1 two-handed weapon (1d8+1) or weapon with shield (1d8); **Move** 12; **Save** 14; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**: None.
- [Ophidian](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Ophidian): HD3; **AC** 4 \[15\] or 3\[16\] with shield; Atk 1 two-handed weapon (1d8+1) or weapon with shield (1d8), and bite (0); **Move** 12; **Save** 14; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Reproductive bite.

### Orc

Orcs are stupid, brutish humanoids that gather in tribes of hundreds. Most are subterranean dwellers, and fight with a penalty of -1 in sunlight. Occasionally, war-bands or even entire tribes of orcs issue forth from their caverns to raid and pillage by night. Orcish leaders are great brutes with additional hit dice, and magic-using shamans may also be found in the larger tribes. Orcish tribes hate each other, and will fight savagely unless restrained by a powerful and feared commander, such as a Chaotic high priest or an evil sorcerer.

- Orc: **HD** 1; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 1 by weapon, usually spear (1d6) or scimitar (1d8); **Move** 9; **Save** 17; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 1/15; **Special**: None.

### Origami Warrior

The origami warrior is a creation made of intricately folded paper, in the shape of a full sized human warrior. They move with lightning speed (accounting for the armor class), and blunt weapons inflict only half damage against them. Piercing weapons pass through the paper construction without causing any damage at all, but cutting weapons inflict +1 damage and fire inflicts double damage. Origami warriors wield normal spears. They are generally found in the service of powerful sorcerers, and have magic resistance of 10%. (*Author: Matt Finch)*

- [Origami Warrior](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Origami-Warrior): **HD** 2; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 1 spear (1d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 16; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**: Magic resistance 10%, half damage from blunt weapons, immune to piercing weapons, +1 damage from cutting weapons, double damage from fire.

### Ostrich, Giant

Giant ostriches are large enough to be ridden as mounts, and might be for sale in exotic lands or large cities.

- [Giant Ostrich](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Ostrich-Giant): **HD** 3; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d6); **Move** 18; **Save** 14; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**: None.

### Otyugh

Otyughs live underground, hiding in piles of refuse, for they are scavengers. These bizarre creatures are slightly larger than a human, a mass of flesh mounted on three squat, elephant-like legs. The otyugh has a sensory-organ stalk, and two rough, bone-ridged tentacles used for attacking enemies. Anyone bitten by an otyugh’s mouth has a 90% chance of contracting a fatal disease (death in 3d6 days unless cured). Although they are relatively stupid, otyughs use rudimentary telepathy to communicate with each other (and other telepathic beings, if they are encountered).

- [Otyugh](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Otyugh): **HD** 7; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 2 tentacles (1d8), bite (1d4+1); **Move** 6; **Save** 9; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: Disease.

### Owlbear

Owlbears have the body of a bear, but the beak of an owl (with some feathers on the head and places on the body as well). On an attack roll of 18+ (natural roll), the owlbear grabs its victim and hugs it for an additional 2d8 points of damage.

- [Owlbear](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Owlbear): **HD** 5+1; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d6), 1 bite (2d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 12; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: hug for additional 2d8 if to-hit roll is 18+.

### Owl, Giant

Giant owls are wise, but very predatory – many of them consider humans to be acceptable prey. Their eggs are very valuable on the open market, for if trained from birth, a giant owl can be used as a steed. In bright sunlight, giant owls fight with a penalty of –2 to their die rolls.

- [Giant Owl](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Owl-Giant): **HD** 4; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d8), 1 bite (1d6+1); **Move** 3 (Fly 20); **Save** 13; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Flies silently, -2 to all die rolls in bright light.

## P

### Panther

Panthers are large, carnivorous cats. Black leopards, jaguars, and cougars are all called “black panthers,” and pale versions of the same cats are all called “white panthers.” If a panther hits with both of its front claws, it may draw up its rear legs, raking the victim with these as well (1d3 each).

- [Pegasus](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Pegasus): **HD** 3; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d3), 1 bite (1d6); **Move** 16; **Save** 14; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: Additional rear claw attacks when hitting with both front claws.

### Pegasus

Pegasi are winged horses. Most have feathered wings, but some might have bat wings and some might be evil—at the Referee’s discretion.

- [Pegasus](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Pegasus): **HD** 4; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 2 hooves (1d8); **Move** 24 (Fly 48); **Save** 13; **AL** L; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Flying.

### Peryton

Perytons have the body of a giant eagle, the head of a stag (but with sharp teeth), and cast the shadow of a man. They eat the hearts of their victims, and lair in high mountain aeries. Perytons are magical creatures (of medieval folklore), and consequently a magical weapon is required to hit them.

- [Peryton](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Peryton): **HD** 4; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 1 antler gore (2d8); **Move** 9 (Fly 24); **Save** 13; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 6/400; **Special**: Immune to non-magic weapons.

### Piercer

Piercers resemble stalactites, and drop from cavern ceilings to pierce their victims. After falling (and feeding), they crawl slowly back to the ceiling in order to attack again. Note that the damage inflicted by a piercer is 1d6 per hit die of the creature.

- [Piercer](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Piercer) (1 HD): **HD** 1; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 1 drop and pierce (1d6); **Move** 1; **Save** 17; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 1/15; **Special**: None.

### Pixie

Pixies are nasty, treacherous creatures of the fey, resembling small, winged people. They are naturally invisible, and do not become visible when they attack. After one round of attacks, the general location of the pixies may be discerned while they keep fighting, and they may thus be attacked (although with a -4 to the attacker’s die rolls to hit them). There may certainly be similar fairies that are more powerful than ordinary pixies – these might have arrows that cause sleep, and attack with a bonus of +4 when using arrows.

- [Pixie](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Pixie): **HD** 1d6 hit points; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 1 dagger (1d4) or arrow; **Move** 9 (Fly 18); **Save** 17; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 2/30; **Special**: Invisibility.

### Portal Camel (Sage Beast)

The Portal Camel is an intelligent and magical creature. It resembles a normal camel, except that it has three humps and two heads. Though not as ill-tempered as actual camels, it does have a high opinion of itself – which it will loudly voice, being capable of speech. While a portal camel can be used as a pack or riding animal, it will demand a higher level of care and pay than any prospective hirelings might seek. As with its normal kin, a portal camel is herbivorous and capable of storing water for extended periods. They can carry 350 pounds without discomfort.

The left head of a portal camel can cast Protection from Evil and Mirror Image each twice per day. The right head of a portal camel can cast Dispel Magic, Haste and Slow each once per day. Three portal camels acting together can cast Dimension Door, although they may bicker and argue about which one will get to use it. The necks of a portal camel are snake-like in their flexibility, allowing it to turn one head back to face a rider – perhaps to nip him on the knee.

Portal camels collect stories and legends of the lands and dimensions through which they travel, and often become sages on obscure topics. Their lips are almost as dextrous as human fingers, allowing them to manipulate simple objects. They may be convinced to join an adventuring party or merchant caravan if someone offers to act as guide and interpreter. (*Author: Scott Wylie Roberts, “Myrystyr”)*

- Portal [Camel](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Camel): **HD** 2; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 2 bites (1hp) and 1 kick (1d4); **Move** 15; **Save** 16; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: Magical abilities, cooperative dimension door.

### Pseudo-Dragon

Pseudo-dragons are tiny relatives of dragons or wyverns, less than 2ft long. Like wyverns, they have a tail stinger: the poison is not lethal in 75% of cases, but it induces catalepsy for 1d4 days (saving throw). When they desire, pseudo-dragons can become almost invisible (80% chance not to be seen). They are somewhat resistant to magic (25%), and this resistance extends to any human touching the creature (if the pseudo-dragon desires).

- Pseudo-[dragon](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Dragons): **HD** 2; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d3), 1 tail sting (1d3 + poison); **Move** 6 (Fly 25); **Save** 16; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Poison, invisibility, 25% magic resistance.

### Purple Worm

Purple worms are massive annelids that grow 40 ft and more in length, and sometimes exceed ten feet in width. They are subterranean, chewing tunnels in rock (or through sand, in deserts, where they are a tan color). These beasts swallow their prey whole on a roll 4 higher than the needed number, or if the worm rolls double the number required to hit. They can swallow anything the size of a horse or smaller. In addition to the worm’s dreaded bite, it has a poison stinger on its tail, the length of a sword and just as deadly even from the piercing wound it inflicts. In addition, the poison injected by the stinger is lethal if the victim fails a saving throw. What prey the purple worms once hunted with such natural weaponry (or perhaps still do, in deep places), must have been terrifying indeed. Aquatic versions of the purple worm might also exist.

- [Purple Worm](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Purple-Worm): **HD** 15; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 1 bite (2d12), 1 sting (1d8 + poison); **Move** 9; **Save** 3; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 17/3500; **Special**: Poison sting, swallow whole.

## Q

### Quadricorn

Quadricorns resemble two-headed bulls, although the body is somewhat more massive than that of a normal bull, to accommodate the two heads. Unlike unicorns, with their propensity toward virgins, quadricorns have somewhat the reverse propensity, sometimes charging into villages or towns to find houses of ill-repute, where they batter down walls or doors in an attempt to escape with a captive or two.

In general, quadricorns live in barren wilderness areas, and can even be found making their lairs in caves, although they are not generally found in deeper subterranean catacombs. (*Author: Matt Finch)*

- Quadricorn: **HD** 6; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 4 horns (1d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 11; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: Magic resistance (25%).

### Quarn

Quarns resemble large boulders, although they do not ordinarily grow much larger than the size of a person. They cannot move other than an ability to rise from or to sink into the stone where they are planted. A quarn does have two arms, which are kept folded against the rest of the body until the quarn attacks. If the quarn hits an opponent, the victim must make a saving throw or begin turning into stone. This process begins immediately with the effects of a *slow* spell, but the process will become complete after 1d4+1 days, at which point the victim will become stone. Until the process is complete, the effects can be reversed with a *remove curse* or *cure disease* spell, but once the transformation is complete, only a *flesh to stone* spell can return the victim to normal. Quarns are slow, and will always attack last in a melee round. Because quarns are immobile, they can cause areas to be hazardous, but colonies of them can be dashed through or bypassed once the nature of the threat is known. (*Author: Matt Finch)*

- Quarn: **HD** 4+4; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 2 fists (1d6 + petrification); **Move** 0; **Save** 13; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 6/400; **Special**: Turn to stone, sink into ground.

### Ragged Craw

Ragged Craws are wingless, intelligent bird-people with beaks and clawed hands, who shroud themselves in tattered cowled robes. They tend to be nomadic, often travelling in small groups (1d6+6) in covered wagons. Ragged Craws are fond of carousing and many (1in 10) have alcohol problems, quickly becoming morose and violent. These creatures are inherently magical and have the power to detect and dispel magic. In combat, they use darts coated with a mild poison that causes sleep for 1d6 rounds. The regurgitated food of a Ragged Craw often possesses healing properties when applied as a paste over open wounds (4 in 6 chance of healing 1d4 HP over a day). Ragged Craws have gained notoriety as slavers, gamblers, thieves and wastrels. (*Author: Sean Wills)*

- [Ragged Craw](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Ragged-Craw): **HD** 3; **AC** 9 \[10\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d4) and beak (1d3) or sleeping darts (1d2+sleep); **Move** 12; **Save** 14; **AL** N; **CL/XP**4/120; **Special**: Detect magic, dispel magic (as 4th Level Magic User).

### Rakshasa

Rakshasas are evil spirits from Indian mythology. Their true form is that of a demon with the head of a tiger or other predatory animal, but by magical illusion they always appear to others in a friendly or nonthreatening form. Rakshasas can only be affected by the most powerful of spells (level 8 or 9), and they can only be hit with magical weapons. Crossbow bolts that have been blessed by a Cleric are the bane of the rakshasa – such bolts are treated as +3 weapons against them. Rakshasas are minor spell casters, able to cast Magic-User spells (3/2/1) and Cleric spells (1 Level-1 spell). Typical spells for a rakshasa might be:

Magic-User level 1: *Magic Missile* x3; level 2: *Mirror Image*, *Web*; level 3: *Fly*

Cleric level 1: *Cure Light Wounds*

- [Rakshasa](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Rakshasa): **HD** 7; **AC** –4 \[23\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d3), 1 bite (1d6); **Move** 15; **Save** 9; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 12/2000; **Special**: Illusory appearance, special magic resistance, spells

### Ranine

Ranine are degenerate, subterranean creatures who serve the foul frog-demon Tsathoggua. Like their master, the Ranine are of broadly batrachian appearance but possess small bat-like ears in addition to vicious fangs and, in many cases, small horns. They are drawn to underground locations suffused with Chaotic energies, so many also possess chaotic traits of both the major and minor varieties.

Ranine shy away from sunlight and suffer a -1 penalty to their attack rolls and saving throws when they operate aboveground. If given sufficient room in combat, these creatures can hop at enemies, which gives them a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls. When fighting at close quarters, they try to bite opponents in order to inject them with a paralyzing poison. Failure to save against it results in paralysis for 3d6 turns. Ranine in groups larger than six typically include a leader, who can cast clerical spells as if it were a cleric of the same level as his hit dice.

Precisely how the Ranine reproduce is a mystery, as they appear to be completely asexual. Given that these beings prefer to take opponents prisoner rather than slay them outright, some sages have postulated that the Ranine somehow “convert” their prey into new frog-men to swell their ranks. If true, these creatures pose an even more terrible threat to civilization than is commonly supposed. (*Author: James Maliszewski)*

- [Ranine](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Ranine): **HD** 2; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d6) and 1 bite (1d4 + paralyzation), or 1 weapon (1d8); **Move** 9 (Swim 12); **Save** 16; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: Breathe Water, Hop, Paralyzing Bite

### Ratling

Standing no taller than 4ft tall, ratlings, as their name implies, resemble humanoid rodents. Although not much of a threat individually, ratlings tend to attack in packs (of 4d6). Ratlings dealing damage via a bite may infect their victims with the same disease that mundane rats do. The chances of passing on the disease are identical to that of their giant-rat kin. (*Author: Skathros)*

- [Ratling](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Ratling): **HD** 1; **AC** 9 \[10\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d6+disease) or weapon; **Save** 17; **Move** 12; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 2/30; **Special**: Diseased bite.

### Rats

#### Rat, Giant

Giant rats are often found in dungeons, and are about the size of a cat, or perhaps a lynx. The bite of some (1 in 20) giant rats causes disease. A saving throw is allowed (versus poison). The effects of the disease are decided by the Referee.

- [Giant](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Giants) [Rat](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Rats): **HD** 1d4hp; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d3); **Move** 12; **Save** 18; **AL** N; **CL/XP** A/5; **Special**: 5% are diseased.

Giant rats (monstrously huge) are often found in dungeons, and are vicious predators the size of a wolf. The bite of some (1 in 20) giant rats causes disease. A saving throw is allowed (versus poison). The effects of the disease are decided by the Referee.

- Monstrously Huge [Giant](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Giants) [Rat](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Rats): **HD** 3; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d3), 1 bite (1d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 14; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 3/120; **Special**: 5% are diseased.

#### Rat, (Giant Desongnol Rat)

The Desongnol rat in its larger form, about the size of a cat, is feared by farmer, woodsman and adventurer alike. It has a rather large nose and an extremely nasty temper and bite. When attacking, the Desongnol rat uses its venom to sicken its prey (in humans, a -1 damage penalty or similar effect) and then tears at it with its powerful claws to allow the rat to feed. It has been said to give off pig-like noises and to have a particular stench when in large numbers. These rats are usually found lurking near farms and settlements where food is easy to forage. It is known for constructing complex tunnel systems large enough for a small human/demi-human (halfling sized or smaller) to enter. (*Author: Chgowiz)*

- [Giant](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Giants) Desongnol [Rat](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Rats): **HD** 1d4hp; **AC** 7 \[12\], **Atk** 1 bite (1d2) and 2 claws (1d3); **Move** 12; **Save** 18; **AL** N; **CL/XP** B/10; **Special**: Non-lethal poison +2 to save, effects are up to the referee.

#### Rat, Wizard's Lab

Wizard’s lab rats are giant rats that have been subjected to any number of strange scientific or magical experiments, and have acquired one of a variety of permanent conditions. To determine the condition of a given lab rat, roll once on the magical potion table in the rulebook, with the lab rat gaining the indicated effect as a permanent ability. Ignore poison potions (these rats would have died in the laboratory) and note that a healing potion indicates a number of hit points regenerated per turn. A character bitten by a lab rat has a 5% chance to gain the lab rat’s condition for 1d6+1 turns. Any particular lab rat has a 20% chance of possessing human-like intelligence. (*Author: Random)*

- Wizard’s Lab [Rats](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Rats): **HD** 1; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** Bite (1d4); **Move** 12; **Save** 17; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 2/30; **Special**: Magical effects.

### Raven, Giant

Intelligent and malign, giant ravens are almost as large as a man. They are ideal servants and scouts for powerful evil sorcerers and other such overlords.

- [Giant Raven](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Raven-Giant): **HD** 3; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d8); **Move** 2 (Fly 20); **Save** 14; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: None.

### Ray, Giant Manta

Giant manta rays are large enough to swallow most opponents whole (anything smaller than a giant), which they will do if they exceed their needed to-hit number by 3 or more. Anyone swallowed will die in 6 rounds unless the manta is slain (the victim can fight from the inside). A hit by the tail spine stuns the victim for 1d8 rounds (saving throw). Some claim that there is a highly intelligent and evil variety of giant manta rays in the deeper seas.

- [Giant Manta Ray](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Ray-Giant-Manta): **HD** 8; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 1 bite (2d6), tail sting (2d10); **Move** (Swim 18); **Save** 8; **AL** N (or C); **CL/XP** 10/1400; **Special**: Swallow whole, tail stuns.

### Ray, Sting

Sting rays are very difficult to see on the ocean floor. They have a poison sting which they use to defend themselves when danger comes near. Sting ray poison causes paralysis (3d6 turns) and also inflicts 3d6 points of damage. A successful saving throw avoids all effects from the poison.

- [Sting Ray](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Ray-Sting): **HD** 1d6hp; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 1 sting (1d3 + poison); **Move** (Swim 10); **Save** 17; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 2/30; **Special**: non-lethal poison.

### Razor Wing

Razor Wings get their name from their razor sharp wings, which they use to bring down potential prey. Razor Wings resemble large crows with shinning steel-like feathers tipping their wings. They attack in groups, swarming over prey from above. Razor Wings will swoop down from above with such swiftness that anyone acting after the bird’s initiative is unable to engage it in hand-to-hand combat. (*Author: Skathros)*

- Razor Wings: **HD** 1; **AC** 7 \[12\]; **Atk** 1 beak (1d4), claw (1d4), or [razor wing](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Razor-Wing) (1d6); **Move** 9 (Fly 12); **Save** 17; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 2/30; **Special**: Swoop attack.

### Recurser

Recursers are intelligent entities from the Plane of Entropy. They are never encountered randomly, but are drawn to the material world by those who try to alter space or time through the use of magic. Recursers appear as shimmering spheres of black electricity, which seem to absorb light rather than emit it. When a recurser appears, it will begin moving towards the one responsible for its appearance immediately, and cannot be diverted. Recursers attack their victims by absorbing them with an entropic touch, which passes through armor or any magical protection as if the target was completely unprotected (AC 9\[10\]). Recursers can only be hit by magical weapons with a bonus of +1 or better. These creatures - or manifestations - are essentially mindless, and exist purely to destroy anyone or anything that attempts to alter the course of fate. They do not bargain, nor will they surrender. The sight of a recurser is terrifying, and anyone who observes one must make a saving throw or be paralyzed by fear for 1d3 rounds. Recursers do not need food or sleep, and will track the object of their attention tirelessly until they are successful or defeated. There can never be more than one recurser on the Material Plane at any time. (*Author: Russell Cone)*

- [Recurser](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Recurser): **HD** 5+10; **AC** 1 \[18\]; **Atk** Entropic Touch 3d6; **Move** (Levitate 10); **Save** 12; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 7/600; **Special**: Entropic touch, causes fear, immune to non-magical weapons.

### Redwraith

Redwraiths are undead creatures that appear much like wights, although their eyes are red and they are often garbed in crimson, for it is the only color they can perceive, and they take red-colored items from those they kill. Redwraiths are weaker than their kin, the wights and true wraiths, but share many characteristics of this type of undead. If a redwraith hits an opponent, the attack drains 1,000 experience points from the victim as well as inflicting damage. Redwraiths are turned as wights, and take 2d4 points of damage from holy water. If a creature is drained of all life energy by a redwraith, roll d100 to determine the result. 01-40: the creature rises as a weaker redwraith under control of the original one, 41-50: the creature rises as a wight (not under control of the redwraith), 51-00: the creature’s body is animated as a zombie under the redwraith’s control.

The weaker redwraiths created when a full redwraith drains a victim of all life energy have only 2 hit dice and drain only 400xp with a successful hit. These creatures slowly gain strength over a period of years, eventually becoming full redwraiths that are no longer under the control of the original. For this reason, redwraiths of 3 or 4 hit dice may also be encountered, these being able to drain 200xp per hit die of the creature. These nascent redwraiths have Low intelligence, and can be tricked into attacking a red item such as a prominently-flourished red cloak. Full redwraiths will not be fooled by such tricks, although they are likely to focus their attacks against anyone wearing red. (*Author: Matt Finch)*

- Redwraith: **HD** 5; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 1 claw (1d8); **Move** 12; **Save** 12; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: Drain life energy, silver or magic weapon to hit.

### Reef Walker

Reef walkers are a cluster of anemones with a rudimentary intelligence, shaped into a large bipedal “body” covered all over in the stinging tentacles characteristic of anemones. They walk slowly through coral reefs, stopping often to flatten out into a less threatening shape and wait for schools of fish to approach. Their random meanderings sometimes take them onto land, where they can survive for up to two hours or so, and they continue hunting along the coastline before returning to their reefs. If a reef walker should stumble upon a coastal village, it may return several times to find more prey, for a village full of humans is an excellent hunting ground. If a reef walker hits an opponent, its stinging tentacles inject a paralytic poison (-3 save). (*Author: Thomas Clark)*

- [Reef Walker](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Reef-Walker): **HD** 7; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 1 arm (1d6+paralysis); **Move** 9; **Save** 9; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: paralyze prey.

### Remorhaz

Remorhaz live in arctic regions, burrowing tunnels into the snow and ice. They resemble massive centipedes (30ft long), with fan-like rudimentary wings. They generate intense internal heat. Remorhaz with 10 or more hit dice can swallow man-sized prey whole (natural 20 required), and the monster’s internal temperature instantly kills anyone swallowed. The top of a remorhaz glows red with heat, and will melt non-magical weapons (also dealing tremendous damage to anyone touching it.

### Retriever

Retrievers are massive (20ft tall) spider-mechanisms built of metal. Some claim that these infernal devices are actually built in the hells and underworlds, which is not certain, but the malign intelligence built into them is unquestionably evil and destructive. Every third round, the retriever can shoot a magical ray from its eyes, having one of four effects: fire, cold, or electricity (4d6 hit points, save for half), or flesh-to-stone (save applies). No to-hit roll is required for the rays, but the particular effect each time is random. If one of the retriever’s claws hits on a natural roll of 20, it holds the victim and crushes for automatic damage in future rounds.

- [Retriever](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Retriever): **HD** 10; **AC** –1 \[20\]; **Atk** 4 claws (1d8), eye-ray; **Move** 9; **Save** 5; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 13/2300; **Special**: Eye rays, crushing damage on natural 20.

### Rhinoceros

[Rhinoceros](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Rhinoceros) are aggressive and stupid. They inflict double damage when charging.

- [Rhinoceros](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Rhinoceros): **HD** 8; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 1 horn (2d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 8; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: Double damage on charge.

### Rhinoceros, Wooly

Wooly rhinoceros are Pleistocene beasts, found in the ice ages of strange worlds, and in the cold wastes of the far north. They have extremely long horns and a shaggy coat of hair.

- [Wooly Rhinoceros](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Rhinoceros-Wooly): **HD** 10; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 1 horn (2d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 5; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 10/1400; **Special**: Double damage on charge.

### Rock Weasel, Giant

Rock Weasels are Giant Weasels that have come into contact with potent transmutative magic, becoming attuned to the elemental earths. This magical attunement manifests itself in the form of a breath attack; rock weasels can spit forth a 10ft long cone of rock shards and pebbles, inflicting 8 hit points of damage to all within this area (save negates). Rock Weasels emit low, grumbling vocalizations reminiscent of stone grinding against stone, and their eyes are black as coal. Their earthy nature makes them slower than normal Giant Weasels, but sturdier opponents in close combat. (*Author: Andrew Trent)*

- Rock Weasel: **HD** 4; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 1 bite (2d6); **Move** 9; **Save** 13; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Stone Breath

### Roc

Rocs are the mythological great birds of legend, large enough to prey upon elephants. They can be trained as fledglings to serve as steeds, so roc eggs or fledglings would be a prize indeed, worth great sums of gold. Rocs might grow as large as 18 HD, with commensurately increased statistics.

- [Roc](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Roc): **HD** 12; **AC** 4 \[15\]; **Atk** 1 bite (3d6), 2 claws (2d6); **Move** 3 (Fly 30); **Save** 3; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 13/2300; **Special**: None.

### Roper

Ropers are shapeless but extremely tough-skinned organisms, with about the body mass of a hill giant. They look very much like stone, and can shape themselves to resemble a natural pillar, stalagmite, lump, or any other simple rock formation. To attack, the roper hurls out long tendrils with a range of 50ft (one per round); the roper can use as many as six of these tentacles at a time. If the tentacle hits, it grabs the victim and draws him 10ft per round toward the roper’s huge, tooth-filled mouth. The victim must make a saving throw or lose half his strength points due to the secretions on the tentacle (3d6 turns). A human has a 1 in 6 chance per round to break the roper’s hold if his strength has been halved, 2 in 6 if his strength remains normal. Ropers are immune to electricity and take only half damage from cold, but they are susceptible to fire, taking +1 damage per hit die inflicted by fires (e.g., a 6 hit die fireball inflicts +6 damage).

- [Roper](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Roper) (10 HD): **HD** 10; **AC** 0 \[19\]; **Atk** 1 tentacle (weakness), 1 bite (2d10); **Move** 3; **Save** 5; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 11/1700; **Special**: tentacles grab and cause weakness.

### Rot Grub

Rot grubs are sometimes found, as one might expect from the name, anywhere flesh is left to rot. They are horrid things about an inch long, but they are quite dangerous – any flesh touching them is at great risk, for they bite in and burrow deeply (rolling to hit). For a period of 1d3 turns, rot grubs can be killed by burning (1d6 points of damage will be inflicted per rot grub). Casting Cure Disease will kill all the rot grubs in a person’s body. After the 1d3 turns elapse, however, the grub has burrowed too deeply to be affected by spells or fire, and the victim will die within one more turn.

- [Rot Grub](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Rot-Grub): **HD** 1hp; **AC** 9 \[10\]; **Atk** 1 burrow; **Move** 1; **Save** 18; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 1/15; **Special**: Burrows to heart.

### Rot Pudding

Rot puddings are nasty subterranean creatures with slug-like bodies made of some viscous substance, looking much like a dark grey jellyfish. These puddings are scavengers in the dark caverns and hallways of underground places. The carrion diet of rot puddings makes them into seething incubators for all kinds of disease, and although they are themselves immune to sickness they are highly contagious host-creatures that can transmit all manner of plagues by the merest touch.

The diseases carried by a rot pudding can be transmitted in various ways during a combat with adventurers. First, if the pudding itself hits a character, the character must make a successful saving throw or be infected. Secondly, if the pudding is hit by a bladed weapon (not a piercing or blunt weapon), the wound will squirt a pus-like substance which will cause the attacker to make a saving throw or contract the disease. There is also a third possibility: if the pudding is burned by a fire larger than a torch, the disease from its surface will temporarily be burned off into a cloud of noxious smoke, which (unless there is some fairly strong source of moving air) will be roughly ten feet in diameter and will drift in a random direction each round at a speed of 1. Anyone in the cloud must make a saving throw or contract the disease. There is one beneficial effect of burning away the surface contagion of a rot pudding, which is that the creature’s touch will not cause disease until 3 rounds have passed.

The disease, if a character is infected, has the following effects. The character will immediately be wracked with pains and aches, affected as per a *slow* spell (able to act and move only at half normal speed). After a period of 24 hours, the character must begin making saving throws once every 6 hours. The first failure of such a saving throw causes the character to fall into a comatose state. The second failed saving throw causes death. A cure disease spell will cure a diseased character, and although a neutralize poison spell will not remove the disease it will grant a +1 on all saving throws. A character who is infected with the disease also become contagious, although the contagion is much less virulent than the concentrated effect of an actual rot pudding. Anyone approaching within ten feet of an infected person has a 50% chance to have to make a saving throw against contagion, and if the saving throw fails, the disease is transmitted in the same form as if it had been contracted from the pudding.

Rot puddings are immune to cold and electricity. A *cause disease* spell will cure one half of any damage that has been inflicted upon the creature. (*Author: Matt Finch)*

- Rot Pudding: **HD**8; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 1 (2d8 + disease); **Move** 6; **Save** 8; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 9/1100; **Special**: Disease, immunities.

### Rothran

Strange ursine humanoids from the plane of darkness, Rothran often inhabit ruins and dungeons where they seek out magical treasures, which draw them as honey draws earthly bears. Rothran show a strong animosity towards arcane spellcasters. So consumed are they by this vicious hostility that they will seek out magic-users in combat whenever possible, even to the extent of leaving themselves vulnerable to other attackers. Rothran are extraordinarily resistant to magic. (*Author: Andrew Trent, “the Venomous Pao”)*

- [Rothran](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Rothran): **HD** 5; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d6), 1 bite (1d10); **Move** 9; **Save** 12; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: Immune to magic weapons, Magic resistance (90%)

### Rottentail

Rottentails are carnivorous, man-sized humanoids with rabbit-like heads (floppy ears etc). The rest of their race, which lives on a distant planet, moon, or plane of existence, exiled huge numbers of their kind who carry a horrible disease endemic to the species -- these are the rottentails. Scabby, smelly and forever drooling, the outcasts have survived the plague that caused their exile, but they pass on a weaker strain of it to anyone with whom they come into close proximity (20ft). Anyone coming this close to a rottentail must make a saving throw: if the saving throw fails, the victim’s rate of healing is reduced to half normal for the next 2d6 days, and he suffers from frequent vomiting until the disease has run its course. Most rottentail tribes live below ground, and all have excellent low-light vision. The brutal, warlike culture of this species leads many of the rottentail warrens near human civilization to work as mercenaries or scouts when they are hired, and as bandits when they aren’t. Rottentails, perhaps because of their otherworldly origins, are somewhat resistant to magic directed at them, but they are unable to cast spells themselves. These scabbed and obviously diseased creatures are far stronger and more vicious than they might appear at first sight, and they are extremely skilled in combat, being exceptionally adept at sizing up an opponent’s skills and fighting style. They tend to fight defensively, without attacking, at the outset of most combats, which causes enemies to attack at a -2 penalty to hit; each combat round spent evaluating an opponent in this way gives the rottentail a cumulative bonus of +1 to hit when he eventually decides to strike. (The bonus is only for the one attack, and cannot be made at more than +3). Rumour has it that rottentails often subdue badly outnumbered opponents, in order to feast upon their still-living flesh back in the rottentails’ underground warrens. They also have a strong breeding urge, and those who have established a warren are very territorial. Rottentails who fight for a living tend to favour patchwork leather armour and many wield twin short swords, although swordstaves (a two-handed weapon that allows them to reach into the second rank of an enemy formation) are also popular. (*Author: Sean Wills)*

- [Rottentail](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Rottentail): **HD** 3; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 2 short swords (1d6) or swordstave (1d8+1); **Move** 14; **Save** 14; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Disease, delayed strike, 30% magical resistance.

### Rusalka (Water Witch)

Rusalka are undead maiden-witches that haunt the cold rivers and lakes in which they drowned. In appearance, rusalka first appear to be comely maidens, clad only in fog. Upon close inspection, however, they are cadaverous with disheveled hair and eyes that shine with evil green fire. Anyone who gazes into the rusalka’s eyes must save versus spells or fall under the effect of a charm person spell. The rusalka then leads her charmed individuals under the cold water to drown. Drowning victims will awaken from the charm, but take 2d8 damage first (for the purpose of the Rusalka, drowning inflicts 2d8 points of damage per round). The touch of a rusalka paralyzes for 1–4 turns (saving throw negates). Paralyzed victims are carried down to the monster’s underwater lair to drown. When a drowning victim attempts to escape from the rusalka’s clutches, there is a base 50% chance that the victim may reach the surface (and air) each round, reduced by 5% for each point of strength below 16, and increased by 5% for each point of strength over 16. Paralyzed victims obviously have no hope of escape on their own and will soon drown. Magic weapons are needed to strike a rusalka, and they are immune to mind-affecting spells as well as other attacks and magic that do not affect undead. Once per day, a rusalka may create a wall of fog. Rusalkas are turned as wraiths. Females slain by a rusalka will themselves rise as rusalkas the next night, and will serve the rusalka who slew them until that rusalka is herself destroyed. Rusalkas are repulsed by holy symbols and by the herb absinth. (*Author: John A. Turcotte © 2006)*

- Rusalka: **HD** 4+3; **AC** 3 \[16\]; **Atk** 1 bite (special); **Move** 9 (Swim 18); **Save** 13; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: Charm, paralyze, drown victims, immune to non-magic weapons, immune to mind-affecting spells, normal undead immunities, create wall of fog.

### Rust Monster

These bizarre creatures are about man-size, and look vaguely like an armadillo; they have armored hide, two antennae, and a long tail with a flanged growth at the end. Rust monsters do not attack people – they turn metal into rust and eat the rust – but they just can’t resist trying to eat delicious foods like swords and plate mail, even if they are being attacked. A hit from a rust monster’s antennae causes metal to rust into pieces, and the same is true for metal objects striking the rust monster’s body. Magical metal has a 10% cumulative chance to avoid rusting per +1 bonus of the armor or weapon.

- [Rust Monster](http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/swords-and-wizardry-srd/for-the-referee/monsters/all-monsters#TOC-Rust-Monster): **HD** 5; **AC** 2 \[17\]; **Atk** 2 antennae (0); **Move** 12; **Save** 12; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Cause rust.

### Tangtal (Dupli-cat)

A tangtal is about 7 feet long from nose to tail and weighs about 350 to 400 pounds. It has short, stiff fur, dark brown in color. Small white flecks cover its head, throat and neck, and shoulders. Its legs are long and powerful and end in sharpened claws. It has a long, upward curving tail with a white tip. Once per day, a tangtal can create up to 8 duplicates of itself (otherwise similar to mirror image spell).

- Tangtal: **HD** 3; **AC** 6\[13\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d4+1), 1 bite (1d6); **Move** 15 (Swim 6); **Save** 14; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: once/day create 8 mirror images

### Tangle Weed/Strangle Vine

Tangle Weeds and Strangle Vines are essentially the same creature, the only difference being that the Tangle Weed attacks its victims from below, while the Strangle Vine attacks from above. In appearance, they resemble a mass of weeds or vines, their animate nature only becoming apparent during an attack.

On a successful attack, the animate plant has a 2 in 6 chance of entangling its foe, immobilizing its prey and slowly strangling the life out of him. Each round, the victim will suffer 1d6 points of damage due to the strangulation. A successful save is required to break free of the immobilizing, strangling grasp. (*Author: Skathros)*

- Tangle Weed/Strangle Vine: **HD** 4; **AC** 6\[13\]; **Atk** 4 vines (1d6); **Move** 0; **Save** 13; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 6/400; **Special**: Strangulation.

### Tatzelworm

These curious creatures inhabit cold alpine peaks. In appearance, they look like silvery fat-bodied lizards lacking hind legs. They can move surprisingly fast, slithering on their stomachs, and can leap up to 10ft. They are notoriously aggressive and will not hesitate to attack larger creatures that intrude upon their territory. When leaping to the attack, they gain a +1 bonus to hit. The bite of a tatzelworm is deadly, and a victim must successfully save versus poison or die.

These cold-loving reptiles save at +1 against cold-based attacked, and such damage against them is reduced by 1 hit point per die. They save versus fire normally. (*Author: John Turcotte)*

- Tatzelworm: **HD** 1d6hp; **AC** 6\[13\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d3hp + lethal poison); **Move** 12; **Save** 18; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 2/30; **Special**: Lethal poison, leap (+1 to hit), partial resistance to cold.

### Tendriculos

A tendriculos is a plant creature resembling a hillock or haystack, but it is a voracious predator that uses tendrils and a powerful bite to kill and digest prey. If the tendriculos hits with both tendrils, the victim must make a saving throw or be swallowed whole. Each round spent within the plant’s body automatically inflicts 1d6 hit points of acid damage and necessitates a saving throw to avoid being paralyzed for 1d4+1 rounds.

- Tendriculos: **HD** 8; **AC** 4\[15\]; **Atk** 2 tendrils (1d6), 1 bite (2d6); **Move** 9; **Save** 8; **AL** N; **CL**/XP 9/1100; **Special**: Swallow whole.

### Thugtoad

Thugtoads are bipedal toad-men, normally about 4ft tall, but with some growing as large as 6ft. Thugtoads can hop as far as 30ft to attack, adding +1 to hit and inflicting double damage when they do so. Because their skin color changes to match their surroundings, they have a 75% chance not to be noticed when waiting in ambush.

- Thugtoad: **HD** 1; **AC** 6\[13\]; **Atk** 1 weapon (1d6); **Move** 4 (Swim 15); **Save** 17; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 2/30; **Special**: Camouflage, hop.

### Thylacine

Commonly known as the “Lemurian Wolf” or “Ekaru,” Thylacines are carnivorous marsupials with a body somewhat like a wolf’s, although they are not related to wolves or dogs. Thylacines are found in all climates, but prefer forested hills to open areas. Hunters have killed Thylacines that measured seven and a half feet from the tip of the nose to end of the tail. The thylacine’s most dangerous attribute is a large powerful jaw that can be overextended for a disproportionately large bite. They hunt at night in groups similar to wolf packs. When agitated a Thylacine will rear up on its hind legs and secrete a musky odor before leaping on the intended victim. Though they have a poor sense of smell their eyesight is very sharp. Their keen intellect and pack hunting instincts see them employed as guards in certain nobles’ or wizards’ gardens. (*Author: Michael Kotschi)*

- Thylacine: **HD** 2+1; **AC** 7\[12\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d6+1); **Move** 12; **Save** 16; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 2/30; **Special**: None.

### Tick, Giant

Giant ticks drain blood at a rate of 4 hit points per round after a successful hit. Their bite causes disease, which will kill the victim in 2d4 days. (*cure disease* spells will remove the infection.) A giant tick can be forced off a victim by fire or by simply killing it.

- Giant Tick: **HD** 3; **AC** 4\[15\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d4); **Move** 3; **Save** 14; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: Drain blood, disease.

### Tiger

If a tiger hits the same target with both fore claws, it can rake with its rear claws as well, gaining two more claw attacks. Yes, tigers swim, which can be a nasty surprise for fleeing adventurers.

- Tiger: **HD** 6; **AC** 6\[13\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d4+1), 1 bite (1d8); **Move** 15 (Swim 6); **Save** 11; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 7/600; **Special**: Rear claws.

### Tiger, Sabre-Tooth

Sabre-tooth tigers are larger than normal tigers and have huge, curving, front fangs. Like normal tigers, if they hit with both fore claws, they can pull up to rake with their rear claws (2 additional attacks).

- Sabre-tooth Tiger: **HD** 7; **AC** 6\[13\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d4+1), 1 bite (2d6); **Move** 12 (Swim 6); **Save** 10; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: Rear claws.

### Titan

Titans are mythological creatures, almost as powerful as gods. A titan has 2 Magic-User spells of each spell level from 1st-level spells to 7th-level spells, and 2 Cleric spells of each spell level from 1st to 7th. The Referee might choose to substitute other magical abilities for spells—these creatures vary considerably in powers and personalities from one to the next.

One possible spell list for a titan might include the following Magic-User and Cleric spells: Magic-User: *Charm Person* (1), *Sleep* (1), *Invisibility* (2), *Mirror Image* (2), *Fireball* (3), *Fly* (3), *Polymorph Other* (4), *Confusion* (4), *Conjure Elemental* (5), Feeblemind (5), *Anti-magic Shell* (6), *Stone to Flesh* (6), *Limited Wish* (7), *Power Word Stun* (7).

Cleric: *Light* (1), *Protection From Evil* (1), *Hold Person* (2), *Speak with Animals* (2), *Cure Disease* (3), *Dispel Magic* (3), *Cure* *Serious Wounds* (4), *Neutralize Poison* (4), *Finger of Death* (5), *Quest* (5), *Blade Barrier* (6), *Word of Recall* (6), *Earthquake* (7), *Resurrection (Raise Dead Fully)* (7).

#### Titan, Cursed

There are some acts so heinous and foul that the Gods – and fellow Titans themselves – may banish and curse one of the titans to an eternity of horrific toil. Now in a form no longer comely, but appalling and demonic, its powers twisted, these extremely rare creatures will be found forever attending to the geas placed upon them. In one case, such a titan was set as a guardian to slay the endless stream of creatures that emerged through a rift in space and time. Legends tell, too, of a cursed titan doomed to guard a treasure so coveted that all manner of beings would seek to take it…

A cursed titan does not have the controlled spellcasting ability of a normal titan; its magical powers are still very much in evidence, but in a wilder, more feral form. Each of these beings is highly unique, and their powers will vary.

**Aura and Surroundings**

The area around a cursed titan is dangerous to a radius of 10ft. The exact nature of the danger may be one of the following: (1) fire, (2) frost, (3) whirlwind, (4) attacking tentacles, (5) caustic air, (6) lightning. The damage from entering this area will generally be 3d6, with a saving throw allowed to take only half damage. Fire will burn flammable items, frost will paralyze anyone failing a saving throw, whirlwinds will throw people 30ft (saving throw allowed), tentacles will entangle people (saving throw allowed similar to a web spell), caustic air will cause additional 1d4 damage with no saving throw, and lightning will stun for 1d3 rounds and throw 20ft (saving throw allowed).

**Bodily Powers**

A cursed titan will have two of the following three additional abilities: bellow, persuade, or summon. Each of the titan’s two abilities may be used only twice per day. Bellowing causes fear (saving throw allowed) to anyone in hearing. Persuasion causes paralysis as all victims within hearing drop all items and kowtow to the creature (saving throw allowed). Summoning brings 1d4 creatures of CL 5 to the cursed titan’s assistance. These might include (1) 4HD ankhegs, (2) chalkeion hoplites, (3) formian warriors, (4) hell hounds, (5) jackals of darkness, (6) kurok-spirits, (7) owlbears, (8) wights.

**Magical Powers**

In addition to the above, a cursed titan will have one beneficial power and one malevolent power. The Benevolent powers are (1) Reincarnate, (2) Remove Curse/Neutralize Poison, (3) Flesh to Stone, (4) Restoration. Malevolent powers include (1) Stone to Flesh, (2) Earthquake, (3) Creeping Doom, (4) Finger of Death. (*Author: Erol Otus)*

- Cursed Titan: **HD** 16; **AC** 2\[17\]; **Atk** 1 weapon (7d6); **Move** 21; **Save** 3; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 19/4100; **Special**: Magic resistance (50%), immune to non-magical weapons, special abilities.

### Toads

#### Toad, Giant

Giant toads are about the size and weight of a human. They are predators, willing to attack creatures as large as men. Giant toads can attack at the end of a hop, which is in addition to the toad’s normal move.

- Giant Toad: **HD** 3; **AC** 6\[13\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d8); **Move** 6 (Hop 30ft); **Save** 14; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**: Hop.

#### Giant Horned Toad

These lizard-looking creatures are as large as wolves, and are armored with a thick, knobbly hide. The head of a giant horned toad is wedge-shaped, with short, thick horns protruding from the sides. Twice per day, these monsters can squirt a jet of blood from their eyes, directed at a single target within 50ft. The target must make a successful saving throw or take full damage from the caustic blood (4d6 hit points); a successful saving throw results in only half damage. Giant horned toads are normally found only in dry regions such as deserts or badlands. (*Author: Matt Finch)*

- Giant Horned Toad: **HD** 4+4; **AC** 4\[15\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d8); **Move** 6; **Save** 13; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Squirt blood.

#### Giant Ice Toad

These bizarre creatures are as intelligent as men (perhaps more so), and use their long, unwebbed fore-toes to carve structures and tunnels in the ice. They use tools, but do not bother with weapons, for their toothy mouths are quite deadly. An ice toad can radiate intense, damaging cold (10ft) once every second melee round, causing 2d6 points of damage. They can also hop to attack, as giant toads do. In the wilds of the arctic regions, in the deserts of snow and ice, there may be entire cities of these unusual beings, perhaps even civilizations remaining from times before known history.

- Giant Ice Toad: **HD** 5; **AC** 5\[14\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d10+2); **Move** 9 (Hop 10ft); **Save** 12; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 6/400; **Special**: Radiate cold.

#### Giant Poisonous Toad

Giant poisonous toads bite with lethal poison, and their skin is also poisonous to the touch. They are about the size of a large dog, and can attack at the end of a hop, just as non-poisonous giant toads do. These toads can sometimes be brightly colored in vibrant reds and greens.

- Giant Poisonous Toad: **HD** 2; **AC** 7\[12\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d6 + poison); **Move** 6 (Hop 30ft); **Save** 16; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: Poison skin and bite.

### Toad-Hydra

Toad-Hydrae resemble giant toads with multiple heads (usually 4-6), although the body is somewhat longer than that of a toad, and the mouths of a toad-hydra are filled with nasty, sharp teeth. These creatures have one attack per head. Each head can attack either by biting or by flicking out its long tongue in attempt to grab (and later swallow) prey. A toad-hydra will not usually attack with more than two of its tongues; if attacking with three tongues, *all* of the tongue attacks are made at -1, if with four tongues, all the attacks are at -2, etc. If, however, the toad-hydra hits with one of its tongues, the victim is immobilized and the hydra may begin trying to gulp it down in the next round. Gulping attempts are treated as attacks, but rather than dealing damage in hit points, success means the victim is swallowed whole and will die in 1d4+3 rounds. Immobilized opponents can attempt to break free (successful saving throw at -5). *(Author: Matt Finch)*

- Toad Hydra (4 heads): **HD** 6; **AC** 7\[12\]; **Atk** up to 4 bites (1d6+3) and/or up to 4 tongues (grab); **Move** 6/12 (swimming); **Save** 11; **AL** N; **CL/XP 8/800**; **Special**: Tongues grab, regeneration 2hp/round.

### Toad-Man

Toad-men resemble bipedal toads, with warty skin and webbed feet. However, they have blunt horned ridges at the top of the head, and tusk-like teeth jutting upward from the lower jaw. The creatures stand almost seven feet tall, and they are bulkier than humans. The civilization of toad-men can range from that of brutish cavemen all the way to highly cultivated societies with refined arts (the latter are more likely to be of Neutral or Lawful alignment, although this is not always the case).

In some cases, Toad-Men will be found as the ruling class or as war leaders for tribes of thugtoads. These batrachian species do not appear to be related unless the connection lies at some point in the very distant past, but each of the two races can roughly understand the speech of the other.

For the most part, toad-men are a subterranean species, especially the more brutish varieties, but they incur no penalties for fighting in sunlight.

- Toad-Men: **HD** 3; **AC** 6\[13\]; **Atk** 1 weapon (1d8); **Move** 9 (Swim 12); **Save** 14; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**: None.

### Todawan Master

Todawan masters are an enigmatic race of solitary giant toads that have achieved mystic enlightenment. They wear robes and carry a staff. Living solitary lives in the depths of dangerous swamps, todawan masters do not accept students but occasionally answer questions about the future when worthy individuals seek them out. Unfortunately, some todawan masters go bad. These subtle servants of chaos and ruin may assemble bands of thugtoads or other minions, and begin to act as evil masterminds. Such chaotic todawan masters do not often leave their swamps, but their influence can be felt far and wide through the use of assassins, spies, and soldiery. Any todawan master (lawful or chaotic) is a formidable foe. In combat, provided they have at least 40ft for the jump, they can leap into battle and deliver a tremendously powerful kick with their hind legs for 2d6 points of damage; the victim must make a saving throw or be hurled back ten feet to lie prone on the ground, stunned for 1d4 rounds. Todawan masters can block missile weapons with their whirling staffs, with a 75% chance to deflect incoming missiles before the to-hit roll is even made. Their mental discipline is such that they take only half damage from fire and cold. They are immune to all forms of mental control and illusion. Once per day, a todawan master can make a powerful mental attack, suggesting that the victim not follow some course of action. If the victim fails a saving throw (made at -4), he will become unable to force himself to follow whatever course of action the todawan master has prohibited. The skin of a todawan master is coated in an extremely hallucinogenic substance. (*Author: Matt Finch)*

- Todawan Master: **HD** 8; **AC** 1\[18\]; **Atk** 2 staff (1d6) or 1 kick (2d6 + special); **Move** 12; **Save** 8; **AL** L; **CL/XP** 11/1400; **Special**: Leaping kick, block missiles (75%), half damage from fire and cold, immune to mental control and illusion, mental suggestion (1/day).

### Torthri

At first glance, a Torthri may be mistaken for a well-fed leopard or jaguar. While they are related to large feline predators, they are semi-bipedal and of near-human intelligence. In some lands they are venerated as nature spirits and pass freely through humanoid villages. A torthri is capable of walking on all fours, but it can also rise up on its hind legs, and the elongated forepaws are capable of grasping tools, opening containers, etc. When semi-erect, a torthri moves at a reduced movement rate. To run, it must drop to all fours. A torthri can exert a magical Charm upon humans and humanoids by meeting their gaze and concentrating for one round. The saving throw against a torthri’s charm is at a penalty of -2, and those charmed become the creature’s willing slaves and worshippers. Whole villages have been known to come under the sway of a Torthri, constructing shrines in which to offer up food and treasure. Although charmed villagers will tell outsiders that their “spirit cat” is like an overgrown pet, no domestic cats will be found in the village, for the Torthri will slay or drive out all other felines.

If forced into combat, the Torthri can defend itself with claws and bite. However, the claws are weaker than those of its feline kin, and its hands are clumsy; it cannot use missile weapons or complex devices, although it can handle simple weapons such as the spear, staff, club, and axe. It may thus attack with a weapon and bite, and will do so if its true nature is discovered. The Torthri is intelligent enough to realise the value of magical weapons and shields, but cannot utter command words or wear armour. Any treasure possessed by a Torthri will be stored in a village shrine or hidden cave. There persist tales of Torthri speaking through their charmed slaves by telepathy, and of whole villages starving to feed their greedy idols. (*Author: Scott Wylie Roberts, “Myrystyr”)*

- Torthri: **HD** 2+3; **AC** 6\[13\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d2) and 1 bite (1d6) or 1 weapon (1d6) and 1 bite (1d6); **Move** 15 (6 when standing); **Save** 16; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**: Charm gaze.

### Trapper Beast

Trapper-beasts are manta-like creatures resembling the stone floors of the subterranean areas where they live. When prey steps onto the trapper’s body, it whips up its wings to enfold and smother its victims (to a maximum of four). Death occurs in 7 melee rounds. Cold does not damage them, and fire inflicts only half damage.

- Trapper Beast (10HD): **HD** 10; **AC** 3\[16\]; **Atk** 1 Enfold; **Move** 1; **Save** 5; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 11/1700; **Special**: Enfold and suffocate prey.
- Trapper Beast (11HD): **HD** 11; **AC** 3\[16\]; **Atk** 1 Enfold; **Move** 1; **Save** 4; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 12/2000; **Special**: Enfold and suffocate prey.
- Trapper Beast (12HD): **HD** 12; **AC** 3\[16\]; **Atk** 1 Enfold; **Move** 1; **Save** 3; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 13/2300; **Special**: Enfold and suffocate prey.

### Treacherous Treasure

At first glance, a treacherous treasure appears to be an envious pile of riches. In reality, a treacherous treasure is a large, slime-like creature that exudes a sticky film from its pores. Throughout its life span, the slimy critter gathers up various coins, gems, and riches found within most dungeons. These objects stick to the slime’s adhesive secretion, giving it the appearance of a pile of treasure. Once the slimy beast is slain, it will take 1d4 weeks for the adhesive film to lose its bonding properties. Only then may the adventurers claim the slime-beast’s hoard.

A treacherous treasure that remains motionless may surprise its foes (40%). (*Author: Skathros)*

- Treacherous Treasure: **HD** 7; **AC** 3\[16\]; **Atk** 1 slam (3d6); **Move** 6; **Save** 9; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 7/600; **Special**: Surprises foes (40%).

### Treant

Treants are tree-like protectors and “shepherds” of forest trees. Depending upon their size, they have different hit dice and do different amounts of damage: treants of 7 to 8 hit dice inflict 2d6 points of damage with each strike of their branch-like hands, treants of 9–10 hit dice inflict 3d6 points, and treants of 11–12 hit dice inflict 4d6 points. All treants can “wake” trees within 60 ft, allowing them to walk at a rate of 3, and possibly to attack. (No more than two trees at a time can be awake at the behest of a single treant.)

- Treant (7HD): **HD** 7; **AC** 2\[17\]; **Atk** 2 strikes (2d6); **Move** 6; **Save** 9; **AL** L; **CL/XP** 7/600; **Special**: Control trees.
- Treant (8HD): **HD** 8; **AC** 2\[17\]; **Atk** 2 strikes (2d6); **Move** 6; **Save** 8; **AL** L; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: Control trees.
- Treant (9HD): **HD** 9; **AC** 2\[17\]; **Atk** 2 strikes (3d6); **Move** 6; **Save** 6; AL L; **CL/XP** 9/1100; **Special**: Control trees.
- Treant (10HD): **HD** 10; **AC** 2\[17\]; **Atk** 2 strikes (3d6); **Move** 6; **Save** 5; AL L; **CL/XP** 10/1400; **Special**: Control trees.
- Treant (11HD): **HD** 11; **AC** 2\[17\]; **Atk** 2 strikes (4d6); **Move** 6; Save 4; **AL** L; **CL/XP** 11/1700; **Special**: Control trees.
- Treant (12HD): **HD** 12; **AC** 2\[17\]; **Atk** 2 strikes (4d6); **Move** 6; **Save** 3; **AL** L; **CL/XP** 12/2000; **Special**: Control trees.

### Tree Ghost

Tree ghosts are the undead form of a Dryad who was killed by a wraith, vampire, or other such undead creature. They are gaunt and emaciated ghostly horrors, with fingers ending in thorn-like claws, reeking of rotting plant matter. Vines of thorn and briar grow from a tree ghost’s body, writhing around her like snakes. Tree ghosts are partially incorporeal, and are invisible until they attack. In close combat, a tree ghost uses her claws to tear at victims, but she can also hurl a spray of thorns from her serpentine thorn-vines to attack a single opponent at a distance of up to 60ft. Both the thorns and the tree ghost’s claws carry a virulent sap; anyone hit by one of the tree ghost’s attacks must make a saving throw or become ill with a strange delirium that drains away his willpower. The victim loses 1d4 points of charisma per hour, and once his charisma reaches 0 he becomes a servant of the Tree Ghost’s will. He will follow her back to the Corpse Tree and begin sprouting runners and twigs, becoming absorbed into the Corpse Tree (the victim loses 1d4 constitution points per day, and upon reaching a constitution of 0 becomes part of the tree). The process is very painful and foul to look upon. If the Corpse Tree or the Tree Ghost is killed, anyone under the tree ghost’s power who has not started the absorption process will regain lost charisma points at a rate of 1d4 per hour, and will suffer no other effects. Those that have already started to become absorbed into a corpse tree do not fare as well: all constitution loss is permanent, and cannot be reversed without the use of powerful magic. In addition to her poisonous claws and thorns, tree ghosts can exhale an Insect Plague (per the spell) once per day. They can also animate any wooden objects, plants, and other vegetation within 50ft; these animated things can attack and ensnare anyone in the area. Tree Ghosts are immune to normal weapons and can only be harmed by silver and magical weapons. Magic fire affects them, but ice, electricity, and acid have no effect, nor does normal fire. If a tree ghost is killed, but her corpse tree is not, the tree ghost will be reborn 24 hours after being killed. (*Author: Sean Stone)*

- Tree Ghost: **HD** 3; **AC** 6\[13\]; **Atk**: 2 claws (1d3) or thorns (0); **Move** 12; **Save** 14; **AL** C; **CL/XP**: 10/1400; **Special**: Charisma drain, Insect Plague, animate wood, immune to normal weapons, cold, electricity, acid, and non-magical fire.

### Triton

Tritons are almost indistinguishable from mermen, but for their nobler appearance. They are, however, a much more magical race entirely. They are, for instance, almost entirely resistant to magic (90%). Their leaders carry conch horns that summon giant sea horses and panic normal sea animals aiding enemies of the tritons. Many triton leaders also have spell casting powers.

- Triton: **HD** 3; **AC** 5\[14\]; **Atk** 1 trident (1d8+1); **Move** 1 (Swim 18); **Save** 14; **AL** L; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: Magic resistance 90%.

### Triton, Dark

Dark tritons resemble their more benevolent cousins, the normal tritons, but they are malevolent creatures. Just as the normal tritons are rumored to be servants of a sea god, the dark tritons are servants of oceanic demons of various types, most commonly the demon-prince Thalasskoptis (q.v.). Dark tritons have tentacle rather than the fish-like “legs” of normal tritons, and often ride giant moray eels as mounts when traveling in the dark depths of the sea where their make their castle-like lairs on the sea floor.

For every 10 dark tritons, either in their lairs or in hunting parties, there will be a leader with 5 hit dice, and for every 20 there will be another leader with 7 hit dice. If a group with 50 or more is encountered there will also be a chief with 9 hit dice. Dark tritons do not have magic-users as many normal triton bands do, but for each 10 dark tritons encountered there is a non-cumulative 15% chance that the band will include a cleric of level 1d6 (check separately for each set of 10 dark tritons; there is a chance that the band will include more than one cleric).

As with normal tritons, the leaders of the dark tritons (5HD+) are capable of summoning aquatic beasts to do their bidding. Once per day, a dark triton leader may summon sea-creatures, with the following results (1d6):

**1.** 1d3 giant octopi
**2.** 3d10 sharks
**3.** 1 sea serpent (q.v.)
**4.** 3d6 aquatic ghouls
**5.** 1d4 aquatic trolls
**6.** 1 sea-wight (an aquatic wight with normal abilities but swimming) leading 1d6+2 aquatic ghouls

Summoning creatures, even if there are multiple leaders in the dark triton band, is not possible multiple times; all nearby creatures will already have responded to the first call. (*Author: Matt Finch)*

- Dark Triton: **HD** 3; **AC** 5\[14\]; **Atk** 1 trident (1d8+1); **Move** 1 (Swim 18); **Save** 14; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: Magic resistance 75%.

### Troglodyte

Troglodytes are subterranean reptile-people. In battle, they emit a horrible smell that weakens most other races. Failing a saving throw against the smell causes the victim to lose 1 point of strength per round for 1d6 rounds, with the loss persisting for another 10 rounds thereafter. Troglodyte skin is slightly chameleon-like, which allows them to mount very effective ambushes. Troglodytes despise the civilized races and seek to annihilate them, but different clans do not ordinarily work well together. Troglodyte bands are often led by strong specimens, which can be 3 or 4 hit dice monsters.

- Troglodyte: **HD** 2; **AC** 4\[15\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d3), Bite (1d4+1) or by weapon with shield (1d8); **Move** 12; **Save** 16; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**: Stench, chameleon skin.

### Troll

Trolls are as tall as ogres, and just as strong. Unlike ogres, however, they attack with claws and teeth instead of weapons. Trolls regenerate, which is to say that any damage inflicted upon them heals within minutes (3 hit points per round). The only way to utterly kill a troll is to submerse it in acid or burn it. Trolls can even re-grow lopped-off heads and limbs.

- Troll: **HD** 6+3; **AC** 4\[15\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d4), 1 bite (1d8); **Move** 12; **Save** 11; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: Regenerate 3hp/round.

### Tsalakian

Tsalakians exist outside of normal space. It is said that they have no individual wills of their own, but are instead the fearful servitors of some greater malign power. They eternally scheme against, and are in turn defied by, another trans-dimensional race called the Kzaddich (q.v.). Tsalakians appear as tall men, completely enshrouded in cowled cloaks. Although capable of speaking with any sentient being (an innate form of tongues), their voices float bizarrely around them, as though through a ventriloquism spell with a random range and direction. They rarely allow their true forms to be seen, for they are difficult to comprehend. When uncloaked, they have been described as a blurry whirl of teeth forming a rough approximation of a man-like form.

Tsalakians can bend and fold themselves through space, and are therefore extraordinarily difficult to successfully strike (thereby accounting for their high armor class). Moreover, they are fearsome in combat as they have the spell-like ability to blink at will. Their multiple attacks represent their ability to strike from several directions at once. A Tsalakian may divide its attacks among opponents within 20’ of itself. They may move any distance in any given round, ignoring physical or magic obstacles in their path. This functions as an innate form of teleport without error. They can even enter concealed or hidden areas, as they do not perceive space as others do, and can see “around” walls, floors and ceilings. Thus, they can disregard held portals, walls of force and the like. Secret, concealed and hidden doors and traps are always exposed to their weird senses, as are hidden people. Note that they are, however, subject to illusions and cannot perceive invisible, out of phase, ethereal or astral objects or creatures; nevertheless, they are virtually impossible to take by surprise. They are immune to “person” affecting spells, such as charm person. Tsalakians are allowed saving throws against all spells of any kind, take no damage from damage-causing spells on a successful saving throw, and take only half damage if they save successfully. They cannot be restrained by any impediment and act as if wearing rings of free action at all times.

Tsalakians possess the mental power to detect good, evil, and magic at will, to cause fear (saving throw negates), and can sense the exact emotions of any being within 100ft. Tsalakians are usually found in the act of planning or carrying out some great ill, for they perpetually strive to bend all other sentient beings to the will of their dread master. They prefer to work through others, themselves remaining out of the fray if possible, revealing their fearsome abilities only if pressed. Their hatred of the Kzaddich knows no bounds and they will always attack these creatures on sight.

- Tsalakian: **HD** 2+2; **AC** -4 \[23\]; **Atk** 4 weapon attacks (1d4); **Move** Infinite; **Save** 16; **AL** C; **CL/XP**: 7/600; **Special**: Incorporeal/teleport movement, perceive secret and hidden things, immune to spells affecting a “person,” saving throw against all magic, reduced damage from spells, immune to restraint, detect good, magic and evil, sense emotions (empathy).

### Tunnel Prawn

Tunnel prawns are scavengers resembling very large lobsters, with a hard, rocklike shell. These creatures wander through subterranean caverns eating bugs and fungi from the wall, floor, and ceiling. A tunnel prawn can scale walls and move along ceilings with no more difficulty than walking along a floor. These dungeon vermin are easily antagonized, and will attack any living beings venturing near. One tunnel prawn can provide the equivalent of a day’s rations. The meat is tough and very chewy, and keeps for only one day, but is actually quite delicious. Some taverns, usually those located near dungeon entrances, serve tunnel prawn as an item on the bill of fare, and will pay up to 3 gps for a fresh tunnel prawn. The prawns weigh about 20 lbs each. (*Author: Matt Finch)*

- Tunnel Prawn: **HD** 1; **AC** 4\[15\]; **Atk** 2 pincers (1d2); **Move** 6; **Save** 17; **AL** N; **CL/XP**: 1/15; **Special**: Climbing.

### Turtle, Giant Sea

Giant sea turtles do not hunt humans, but they are aggressive in their territory, and are large enough to capsize small ships (15 foot diameter shell). Obviously, the size and hit dice of individual specimens will vary; these stats are for an average adult turtle.

- Giant Sea Turtle: **HD** 15; **AC** 3\[16\] shell, 5\[14\] head/flippers; **Atk** 1 bite (4d6); **Move** 3/12 (swimming); **Save** 3; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 15/2900; **Special**: None.

### Turtle, Giant Snapping

Giant snapping turtles are massive, having a shell with the same diameter in feet as the creature’s hit dice. Their incredibly thick shells make them almost invulnerable to attacks that are not targeted at the head or limbs.

- Giant Snapping Turtle (8HD): **HD** 8; **AC** 2\[17\] shell, 5\[14\] head/limbs; **Atk** 1 bite (4d6); **Move** 4 (Swim 9); **Save** 8; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: None.
- **G**iant Snapping Turtle (9HD): **HD** 9; **AC** 2\[17\] shell, 5\[14\] head/limbs; **Atk** 1 bite (4d6); **Move** 4 (Swim 9); **Save** 6; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 9/1100; **Special**: None.
- Giant Snapping Turtle (10HD): **HD** 10; **AC** 2\[17\] shell, 5\[14\] head/limbs; **Atk** 1 bite (4d6); **Move** 44 (Swim 9); **Save** 5; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 10/1400; **Special**: None.

## U

### Unicorn

Unicorns are generally shy and benevolent creatures, who will allow only a chaste maiden to approach them. They can teleport once per day to a distance of 360 ft, with a rider. The unicorn’s horn has healing properties, according to legend. (The details of this, if any, are left to the Referee). There is considerable room to create variant sorts of unicorns: evil ones, flying ones, etc.

- Unicorn: **HD** 4; **AC** 2\[17\]; **Atk** 2 hoofs (1d8), 1 horn (1d8); **Move** 24; **Save** 13; **AL** L; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: double damage for charge, 25% magic resistance, teleport.

### Urrslumber

By day, the urrslumber is a lurching heap of leafy vegetation, roughly in the shape of a headless bear, with tangled masses of thorny limb-vines extending from a twisted clump of pliable abdominal roots; when stationary, it is nearly indistinguishable from normal plant life. It hunts by ambush, sensing the vibrations of passersby and lunging forth to grapple with its thorny limbs. Its thorns secrete a sleep-inducing poison with effects that last for 1d6 hours, possibly less, depending on size and constitution of the victim. The urrslumber drags sleeping prey back to its lair (often within the root base of an enormous tree), binds the prey, and awaits nightfall. At sunset, the urrslumber transforms into a jet-black bear with red, sightless eyes. In this form, it hungrily devours the captured prey and then falls asleep, transforming back into plant form at sunrise. While in bear form, the urrslumber’s gaze causes blindness for 1d6 rounds (saving throw negates). If it is killed while in plant form, the urrslumber regenerates completely from its remains (even burnt ashes) on the next new moon. Urrslumbers killed in bear form are permanently dead. (*Author: Guy Fullerton)*

- Urrslumber: **HD** 5; **AC** 4\[15\]; **Atk** 1 grapple in plant form (1d6 + sleep poison), or 1 claw or bite in bear form (2d6); **Move** 9; **Save** 12; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 6/400; **Special**: Surprise opponents on a 1-4 in plant form, gaze attack (blindness) in bear form, and the bear form itself is blind.

### Uruak (Scrap Gnolls)

Uruak, or “scrap gnolls” are a race of hyena-like humanoids from an alternate reality, similar to gnolls in appearance but much more intelligent. They are intelligent, civilised, and fanatically obsessed with mechanical devices and inventions. The culture of their world is equivalent to the Bronze Age. Scrap gnolls managed to survive magical cataclysms and inhospitable wastelands by combining their scavenging and tool-using skills. Although their world is now believed destroyed, they have somehow spread across the multiverse. Wherever they go, the landscape is littered with smashed sand ships, exploded steam engines, and rusting piles of scrap left behind their evolving technological skills.

Scrap gnolls spend most of their time creating and testing tools and devices, for they are instinctively gifted artificers. Many scrap gnolls are skilled in alchemy, clockwork, mining and smithing, and they may possess crude explosives (3d6 damage in 10’ radius, must be thrown, may have a timing device of up to 3 rounds) or arquebus-type ‘smoke-powder’ weapons (1d10 damage, backfire and be unusable until repaired on an attack roll of 1). Any weapons they make will be finely crafted and lovingly cared for. In a group of 6 or more scrap gnolls, there will be a leader with magic-user spells and the vision to direct the gnolls in working together towards a major task, as well as a pet snake or scorpion as their mascot. For every male actively inventing, scrounging, or repairing, there will be a female of close kin seeing to the more mundane domestic tasks. All scrap gnolls yearn to regain the expertise of building ornithopters and battle-automata. (*Author: Scott Wylie Roberts, “Myrystyr”)*

- Uruak (Scrap Gnoll): **HD** 2; **AC** 5\[14\]; **Atk** 1 weapon (1d10); **Move** 12; **Save** 16; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 2/30; **Special**: May possess explosives or firearms.

### Vampire Tree (Jubokko)

The Jubokko grow on battlefields or other scenes of bloody carnage, where so much human blood may be shed on the ground that it is sucked up in great quantities by the roots of nearby trees. These trees grow up nourished by this blood, and knowing no other sustenance, they begin to thirst for the blood of human beings. They will await motionless, appearing as a normal tree, until some unsuspecting person passing beneath is snatched up by its branches and murdered, the trees then feast upon their victims blood. If the Jubokko hits with 2 of its branches against a single victim, that victim becomes immobilized and cannot fight or cast spells until freed by his companions. Such a victim becomes AC 9\[10\] for further attacks by the Jubokko.

- Vampire Tree/Jubokko: **HD** 4; **AC** 6\[13\]; **Atk** 4 branches (1d6); **Move** 0; **Save** 13; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 6/400; **Special**: Immobilization.

### Vampire

Vampires are some of the most powerful of undead creatures. They can only be hit with magic weapons, and when “killed” in this way they turn into a gaseous form, returning to their coffins. They regenerate at a rate of 3 hit points per round, can turn into a gaseous form or into a giant bat at will, and can summon a horde of bats or 3d6 wolves out from the night. Looking into a vampire’s eyes necessitates a saving throw at -2, or the character is charmed (per the *Charm Person* spell). Most terrifyingly, a vampire’s bite drains two levels from the victim. Fortunately, vampires have some weaknesses. They can be killed (though these are the only known methods) by immersing them in running water, exposing them to sunlight, or driving a wooden stake through the heart. They retreat from the smell of garlic, the sight of a mirror, or the sight of “good” holy symbols. Any human killed by a vampire becomes a vampire under the control of its creator.

This description will be recognized easily as the “Dracula” type of vampire. Many other possibilities for vampires exist in folklore: Chinese vampires, for instance, and blood-drinkers more feral than intelligent. Plus, other cultural templates with different attributes could be created—how about an ancient Egyptian mummified vampire, or an Aztec vampire?

- Vampire (7HD): **HD** 7; **AC** 2\[17\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d10 + level drain); **Move** 12 (Fly 18); **Save** 9; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 10/1400; **Special**: Immune to non-magic weapons, only killed in coffin, regenerate (3/round), gaseous form, shapeshift, summon rats or wolves, charm gaze, drain 2 levels with hit.

### Vapor Crane

Vapor Cranes make their homes where geysers spews and hot springs make great boiling pools, arranging their rock nests so that they fill with boiling water. Strangely, they do not eat, but draw their sustenance from the steaming waters they inhabit. They will attempt to fly away if they are endangered but they will fight to the death if cornered.

Touching a Vapor Crane without the proper precautions can be deadly, for their bodies are boiling hot (1d6+1 hp/hit die). They are also able to spew clouds of steam from their nostrils as both an offensive and a defensive measure and will use this ability to flee, unless guarding a nest. The steam cloud can be used in one of two ways (3 times per day total): if the crane is attacking, it blows the steam in a cone 30ft long to a width of 30ft, inflicting 1d6 + 1/ hit die. When used defensively, the crane surrounds itself with the cloud in a radius of 15-ft, which not only inflicts damage but also obscures the bird from sight. In normal combat, a vapor crane attacks with its beak, which is filled with needle-sharp teeth. (*Author: Russell Cone)*

- Large Adult Vapor Crane: **HD** 6; **AC** 4\[15\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d4+5); **Move** 5 (Fly 12); **Save** 12; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 7/600; **Special**: Scalding to touch, steam cloud (1d6+1/ hit die) in cone or 15-ft. radius.

### Vargouille

Vargouilles are demonic creatures, a horrid head, bearded with small, writhing tentacles, with bat wings protruding from the back. Their bite is deadly, causing permanent hit point loss (saving throw).

- Vargouille: **HD** 1; **AC** 8\[11\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d4); **Move** 0 (Fly 12); **Save** 17; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**: permanent hit point loss.

### Varn Eternal Gladiator

These are the restless spirits of dead fighters and warriors whose armor continues to fight long after they are gone. The armor stands six feet tall (sometimes taller), and is usually of the plate mail type. Varn carry enchanted weapons, usually a +1 sword or axe. Because it is an animated suit of armor, it has immunity to *charm*, *sleep,* and *cold* spells. However, fire spells do +1 additional damage to eternal gladiators. Varn are typically not used to guard locations, as they will attack anyone who gets near them on sight. They can be found in dungeons, or at the locations of large battles.

A weapon that has been used by an eternal gladiator will be cursed forever after; attempts to remove the curse will simply cause it to collapse into rust. A varn may be turned as a wight.

- Varn: **HD** 5; **AC** 2\[17\]; **Atk** 1 +1 weapon (1d10+1); **Move** 9; **Save** 12; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Undead immunities, takes double damage from fire.

### Vierd

Vierds are creepy, two-headed cousins to ghouls, standing only 3ft tall. They are nocturnal albinos with pink eyes, yellow claws and dirty fangs. Like their kin, they are immune to charm and sleep spells. A vierd has a paralyzing touch on a failed save (2d6 turns), and if bitten, the victim must make a saving throw or contract a disease. The diseased spot must be purified (burning, amputation, holy water, etc.) in order to arrest the spread of the disease. (*Author: Oldcrawler)*

- Vierd: **HD** 2+4; **AC** 6\[13\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d3 + paralysis), 2 bites (1d4 + disease); **Move** 9; **Save** 16; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: Paralysis, disease, immunities.

## W

### Walking Slime

These vaguely humanoid monsters slop their way through underground passages in search of living flesh to “eat.” They attack by smacking prey with their large oozing fists, attempting to cover them and turn them into living slimes as well (on a natural roll of 15+, the victim must make a saving throw or begin transforming into a walking slime). (*Author: Random)*

- Walking Slime: **HD** 2; **AC** 9\[11\]; **Atk** 1 (1d6 + turn to slime); **Move** 6; **Save** 16; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: Transform to slime.

### Wandering Hole

A wandering hole is a creature that exists in a different dimension but extends into the normal world as a living emptiness, a hole in space. In its expanded form, it resembles a 10ft x 10ft hole running 20ft to 50ft deep (1d4+1 x10). The creature possesses the capacity to constrict its anti-mass to a 1/4 inch square. Contracting itself from a 10ft x 10ft square to a 1/4in x 1/4in square takes 1d4+1 rounds. Expanding its form back to 10ft x 10ft takes only 1 round. The most common tactic used by wandering holes is to constrict themselves to their smallest size, then, as an adventurer walks above, the wandering hole expands, sending the victim plummeting down its depth. The wandering hole then compresses itself anew to crush the hapless victim. Victims of this tactic always run the risk of being surprised (50%).

Victims who find themselves within the depths of a wandering hole have but 1d4+1 rounds to get themselves out before the contracting critter crushes them: on the last round, the constricting wandering hole crushes the victim to death.

Wandering holes may be damaged, but only by spells or magic weapons and items. When it dies, a wandering hole returns to its expanded size of 10ft x 10ft, but as a normal, nonliving hole in the ground. (*Author: Skathros)*

- Wandering Hole: **HD** 5; **AC** 1\[18\]; **Atk** 1 special; **Move** 12; **Save** 12; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 7/600; **Special**: Surprise, Constrict.

### Wasp, Giant

Giant wasps are as large as humans, and are incredibly aggressive. Their sting paralyzes (saving throw) for 1d4+1 days (at the end of which time, wasp larvae eat the victim from the inside out). Cure disease will kill the larvae. The wasp wings are paper-thin, and flammable.

- Giant Wasp: **HD** 4; **AC** 4\[15\]; **Atk** 1 sting (1d4 + poison), 1 bite (1d8); **Move** 1 (Fly 20); **Save** 13; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 6/400; **Special**: Paralyzing poison, larvae.

### Weasel, Giant

These ferocious predators are often found in dungeon complexes, for they lair in caves. When a giant weasel hits an opponent, it clamps its jaws and sucks blood, automatically inflicting 2d6 points of damage per round. Giant weasels can be trained as guard animals; although they cannot be trained to warn of intruders, they are far more deadly than guard dogs. Their pelts sell for 1d6x100gp each.

- Giant Weasel: **HD** 3+3; **AC** 6\[13\]; **Atk** 1 bite (2d6 + blood drain); **Move** 15; **Save** 14; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: Drain blood.

### Were-Mist

Despite its name, a were-mist is not a form of true lycanthropy, but is a monster than can inflict involuntary shapechanging upon other creatures. The were-mist attacks by enveloping and attempting to transform an opponent. The creature surrounded by the were-mist must make a saving throw or be transformed into a ravening beast (similar in appearance to a werewolf) that will attack at the were-mist’s directions. The were-mist remains wrapped around the victim, but it can be attacked independently without risk to the controlled creature. The were-mist itself can only be harmed by silver or magical weapons (or with spells), but the beast-form of its slaves may be damaged normally.

When the were-mist’s slave is weakened by combat, the mist will attempt to move on to a new victim. As soon as it departs from a victim, the spell is broken and the slave returns to normal shape and self-control. In battle, the were-mist will attempt to move from victim to victim, causing them to attack their allies, and discarding one puppet when it becomes weak, moving to the next strongest potential victim.

Were-mists are solitary due to their rarity, rather than due to an unwillingness to congregate; in rare instances there might be lairs containing more than one of these creatures. Since they do not appear to reproduce, such better-populated lairs might exist closer to whatever “source” creates the mists. (*Author: Matt Finch)*

- Were-mist: **HD** 3+3; **AC** 4\[15\]; **Atk** 1 enfold (special); **Move** 9; **Save** 14; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 6/400; **Special**: Immune to non-magic weapons, transform and enslave.

### Whales

#### Whale, Killer (Orca)

Killer whales might be found as the allies of any intelligent underwater species, chaotic or lawful, good or evil. Some killer whales are as intelligent as humans, others are not.

- Killer Whale: **HD** 12; **AC** 4\[15\]; **Atk** 1 bite (3d10); **Move** (Swim 24); **Save** 3; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 12/2000; **Special**: None.

#### Whale, Sperm

Sperm whales can swallow small ships whole, and automatically swallow whole any human-sized prey they hit with an attack. Blows from their tails destroy boats and might also destroy ships, or damage them terribly. Some sperm whales are intelligent (and often malevolent).

- Sperm Whale: **HD** 36; **AC** 4\[15\]; **Atk** 1 bite (4d10), 1 tail (4d10); **Move** (Swim 18); **Save** 3; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 37/7400; **Special**: Swallow whole.

### Wight

Wights live in tombs, graveyards, and burial mounds (barrows). They are undead, and thus not affected by sleep or charm spells. Wights are immune to all non-magical weapons, with the exception of silver weapons. Any human killed or completely drained of levels by a wight becomes a wight.

- Wight: **HD** 3; **AC** 5\[14\]; **Atk** 1 claw (1hp + level drain); **Move** 9; **Save** 14; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 6/400; **Special**: Drain 1 level with hit, hit only by magic or silver weapons.

### Wight, Sea

Sea-wights are highly similar to normal wights, originating from bodies in ocean-flooded tombs, bodies that were consigned to the depths of the ocean, or from individuals – usually those of some power – who perished beneath the dark waves. They have a more bloated appearance than normal wights, and their skins are crusted with barnacles or other sea-growths, giving them a somewhat better armor class than a land-wight. In the course of transforming into a sea-wight, the hands and feet become webbed, allowing the creatures to swim at a rate of 90ft.

Sea-wights have a greater tendency than normal wights to associate with and command other undead creatures. Although some sea-wights are solitary, many sea-wight lairs are found in ship graveyards, forest-beds of deep seaweed, and other places that may have a strong evil animus. In this case, the lair will ordinarily contain the following:

1d4+4 Additional **sea-wights**
1d4 **giant zombie sharks** (50% chance)
2d10 **giant zombie piranhas** (q.v.) (75% chance)
1d10 **human zombies** (80% chance)
1 **giant zombie octopus** (10% chance)

All of the zombie creatures in a sea-wight lair will be under the control of the strongest sea-wight. If this wight is killed, 2 rounds will be required for the next strongest sea-wight to establish dominance over the creatures.

Giant zombie sharks and giant zombie octopi have an armor class inferior by 1 point to the normal AC of the living creature, but have an additional hit die. They are otherwise identical to the living form of the creature, but will attack last in any melee round.

As with normal wights, a successful attack by a sea-wight drains one level of experience from the victim, and a fully-drained victim rises as a sea-wight of half normal strength under the command of its killer. (*Author: Matt Finch)*

- Sea-Wight: **HD** 4+3; **AC** 4\[15\]; **Atk** 1 touch (level drain); **Move** 12 (Swim 9); **Save** 13; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 7/600; **Special**: Drain 1 level with hit, hit only by magic or silver weapons, command other undead.

### Will-O-The-Wisp

Will o’ the wisps are phantom-like shapes of eerie light, creatures that live in dangerous places and try to lure travelers into quicksand, off the edges of cliffs, etc. They usually inhabit swamps or high moors. They can brighten or dim their own luminescence, and change their shapes as well, to appear as a group of lights, a wisp of light, or in the glowing wraithlike shape of a human (often female). They will generally depart if the attempt to lead victims into danger fails, but if they are attacked they can defend themselves with violent shocks of lightning-like power. These creatures are intelligent, and can be forced to reveal the location of their treasure hoards.

- Will-o-the-wisp: **HD** 9; **AC** –8\[27\]; **Atk** 1 shock (2d6); **Move** 18; **Save** 6; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 10/1400; **Special**: Lights.

### Wolves

#### Wolf

Wolves are pack hunters, and may be found in large numbers. Male wolves weigh from 80 to 100 pounds.

- Wolf: **HD** 2+2; **AC** 7\[12\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d4+1); **Move** 18; **Save** 16; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 2/30; **Special**: None.

#### Wolf, Winter

Winter wolves are as intelligent as humans, and many packs or their leaders are not friendly to humankind. Some, indeed, are actively malevolent and hostile, hunting humans as prey and stalking arctic villages for lone victims. Winter wolves can breathe frost at a range of 10ft, blasting anything in front of them in a wide area for 4d6 points of damage (save for half). This ability can only be used once per turn (10 rounds). Winter wolf pelts are very valuable (1d4+2 x1000gp).

- Winter Wolf: **HD** 5; **AC** 5\[14\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d6+1); **Move** 18; **Save** 12; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 6/400; **Special**: Breathe frost.

#### Wolf, Worg

Worgs are large, intelligent, and evil wolves. They are believed by many to be normal wolves that are inhabited by malevolent spirits, gaining size and strength accordingly. Others simply believe that worgs are an intelligent species of great wolves.

- Worg: **HD** 4; **AC** 6\[13\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d6+1); **Move** 18; **Save** 13; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: None.

### Wolverine

Wolverines are vicious and tough, living in arctic and tundra (taiga) regions of the world. Its musk is not dangerous, but the smell remains for days, and it spoils food. They attack with a +4 to-hit bonus for their ferocity.

- Wolverine: **HD** 3; **AC** 6\[13\]; **Atk** 1 bite/claw (1d6+3); **Move** 12; **Save** 14; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special**: Musk, +4 to hit bonus.

### Wolverine, Giant

Giant wolverines are larger than their normal cousins, and some of them may be possessed of a malign intelligence. They attack with a +4 to-hit bonus for their ferocity.

- Giant Wolverine: **HD** 6; **AC** 5\[14\]; **Atk** 2 claws (1d4), 1 bite (1d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 11; **CL/XP** 7/600; **Special**: Musk, +4 to hit.

### Wraith

Wraiths are powerful wights, immune to all non-magical weapons other than silver ones (which inflict only half damage). Arrows are particularly ineffective against them, for even magical and silver arrows inflict only one hit point of damage per hit. Wraiths can be found riding well-trained battle steeds or more unusual mounts that will tolerate their presence. Just as wights do, wraiths drain a level of experience from those they hit.

- Wraith: **HD** 4; **AC** 3\[16\]; **Atk** 1 touch (1d6+ level drain); **Move** 9 (Fly 24); **Save** 13; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 8/800; **Special**: drain 1 level with hit, magic or silver weapon to hit.

### Wyvern

A wyvern is a two-legged form of dragon. These creatures are smaller and less intelligent than true four-legged dragons, not to mention that they do not have a breath weapon. Each wyvern has a poisonous sting at the end of its tail. However, they are not coordinated enough to attack with both bite and sting in a single round. In any given round, a wyvern is 60% likely to use its tail, which can lash out to the creature’s front even farther than its head can reach.

- Wyvern: **HD** 8; **AC** 3\[16\]; **Atk** 1 bite (2d8) or 1 sting (1d6+poison); **Move** 6 (Fly 24); **Save** 8; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 10/1400; **Special**: Poison sting.

## X

### Xole

Xoles bear a close physical resemblance to the salamanders of the elemental plane of fire, having a somewhat human head, human arms, and a serpentine body. Rather than being creatures of fire, however, the xoles are creatures of stone, being native to the elemental plane of earth. As such, they are immune to fire and cold, and can be affected by *protection from evil*.

A xole is only slightly larger than a salamander; the torso of a xole is equivalent to that of a seven-foot tall, but massive, person. The tail is almost ten feet in length, which is the reason xoles are categorized as “Large” size. Xoles generally carry heavy stone maces as weapons; even xoles can only wield these weapons two-handed, and they cannot be lifted by any creature not from the elemental plane of earth. If one of the weapons is dropped to the ground, it will dissolve into the stone after a period of a year and one day. If a xole hits successfully with its tail, it inflicts automatic constriction damage thereafter.

Xoles can move through solid rock or earth, although it takes a full round to enter solid stone.

There is no allegiance between xoles and xorns beyond the fact that both types of creatures are native to the elemental plane of earth. Xoles, obviously, are more organized than xorns, and are generally found on the prime material plane in the service of some evil purpose, as contrasted to the neutral and relatively purposeless wanderings of the xorns. (*Author: Matt Finch)*

- Xole: **HD** 8+4; **AC** 2\[17\]; **Atk** 1 two-handed mace (1d10+5) and tail (2d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 8; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 10/1400; **Special**: Constriction, immune to fire and cold.

### Xorn

Xorn are bizarre creatures, originally from the elemental planes of earth, which eat precious metals and other minerals. They have a rock-like consistency, granting an extremely good armor class, and appear to be made of stone. Xorn have a barrel-shaped body, radially symmetrical with three eyes, three arms, three stubby legs, and a powerful mouth set in the top of the creature’s body. The stone-like appearance grants the xorn a tremendously good chance of surprising its enemies.

These creatures are immune to fire and cold damage, and take only half damage from electrical attacks (no damage when saving throws are successful). A xorn can swim through stone, but requires a full melee round to enter solid rock, during which time it cannot attack. Phase Door spells will utterly destroy a xorn that is traveling through rock or readjusting its composition.

Xorn are particularly vulnerable to spells that affect earth and stone. Move Earth spells may be used to hurl a xorn backwards 30ft and stun them for a full round. Stone to flesh and rock to mud spells weaken the xorn’s elemental structure, increasing the creature’s AC to 8 \[11\] until the xorn concentrates for a full round to readjust its composition. Passwall spells inflict 1d10+10 points of damage with no saving throw.

- Xorn: **HD** 7; **AC** –2\[21\]; **Atk** 3 claws (1d3), 1 bite (4d6); **Move** 9; **Save** 9; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 9/1100; **Special**: Immune to fire and cold, half damage from electricity, travel through stone.

## Y

### Yaruga

Named after their distinctive call, Yaruga are agile, hammerheaded lizards, 10 ft. in height, which walk on two long bird-like legs. Yaruga graze on plants and grasses by day, but become vicious hunters by night. During the day Yaruga are skittish and scare easily. They excrete a foul-smelling gas if approached within 50 ft, then run away; the gas blinds anyone within 10ft of the Yaruga for 1d4 rounds (saving throw applies). At night, Yaruga become extremely dangerous and aggressive, chasing their prey down and kicking them to death before feasting on them. When they make the initial charge, a yaruga’s running kick inflicts double damage on a successful hit. Anyone sprayed by Yaruga-gas during the day becomes the main target of the savage lizards by night. In the wild, Yaruga are usually encountered in pairs, day or night, but there may be 2d4 together during mating season. (*Author: Sean Wills)*

- Yaruga: **HD** 3; **AC** 5 \[14\]; **Atk** 1 kick (1d6); **Move** 18; **Save** 14; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**: Blinding flatulence, running kick.

### Yeti

Yetis are the “Bigfoot” of the arctic and the high mountains. If a yeti strikes the same opponent with both fists, it bear-hugs for an additional 2d6 points of damage. Anyone caught in the yeti’s arms like this must make a saving throw or be paralyzed with fear for 1d3 rounds (during which time the yeti hits automatically). Yetis are very intelligent, and can be quite malevolent. They are immune to magical cold.

- Yeti: **HD** 5; **AC** 6\[13\]; **Atk** 2 fists (1d6); **Move** 14; **Save** 12; **AL** N or C; **CL/XP** 7/600; **Special**: Immune to cold, hug, fear.

### Ygg (Gallows Tree)

Ygg (commonly called ‘Gallows Trees’) are ancient, tree-like predators that impale both beast and man on the thorn-covered bark of their snaking branches. An Ygg’s branches can whip out to a distance of 30ft to seize prey, who must make a successful saving throw to avoid being caught (the Ygg can use 1d6 of these branches in any given combat round). Once impaled upon the massive thorns, the life force and nutrients of the victim is drained at the rate of 1 hit point per round, leaving the empty husks to slough off in the fullness of time. Any man-sized creature has a 1 in 6 chance per round of pulling free of the branch. Reeking of putrefaction and festooned with corpses, Ygg roam the countryside in search of flesh, producing a cloud of spores (60ft radius) that draws creatures to them. Prey within the sporecloud must make a saving throw (each round) or be drawn closer to the Ygg. Once the Ygg attacks, these victims come to their senses, but it may be too late. Ygg have no visual organs but can detect any creatures within 60ft using sound, scent, and vibration. They are immune to cold, but are susceptible to fire (+1 damage per hit die). Folklore suggests that the peach-like fruit Ygg produce has magical life-enhancing properties. (*Author: Sean Wills)*

- Ygg: **HD** 8; **AC** 2\[17\]; **Atk** 1d6 impalements (1d6+1 each); **Move** 6; **Save** 8; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 10/1400; **Special**: Immune to cold, spore cloud.

### Yienhool

Yienhools are pale humanoids with long, thin arms and elongated, clawed hands. Their bulging, white eyes are well adapted to dim light, but they are virtually blind in sunlight and never emerge from below ground unless forced to do so. They are deep-dwellers of the underground, but small groups of them are occasionally found in the upper reaches of the subterranean world. Yienhools are more intelligent than animals, but barely so - they can communicate and follow orders, and in packs they can hunt with considerable cunning, but their ability to act independently of a pack or a strong leader is very weak. Yienhool packs swarm their prey, the first ranks grabbing, clutching, and immobilizing to allow their total numbers to swarm over the foe and bring them down. If a yienhool hits, it has grabbed successfully at one of the foe’s arms, rendering weapon or shield unusable as the yienhool clings on, regardless of danger (such attacks are made at -1 to hit). While holding on, the yienhool can make more attempts to grab the other arm as well. Yienhool can swarm over the backs of their fighting brethren to climb past front ranks and into the rear ranks of their opponents. If a yienhool is not already holding an enemy, and chooses not to make grabbing attacks, it can attack with its claws. These creatures are usually encountered in large numbers, for they do not divide into packs of fewer than 6.

Yienhool packs are often led by unusually large and vicious specimens of the race who are much more intelligent – or, at least more cunning – than the average member of the species. These leaders are normally of 3HD, but some can be as large as trolls, with 5-7 hit dice. (*Author: Matt Finch)*

- Yienhool: **HD** 1d6; **AC** 8\[11\]; **Atk** 1 claw (1d4); **Move** 9; **Save** 18; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 1/15; **Special**: grab and pin arms, swarm over the top of battle lines.

### Yith, Hound of

Hounds of Yith are supernatural creatures of the night, resembling large dogs (most say). They are, perhaps, originally denizens of another plane of existence, and they are summoned to the hunt by powerful and malign beings. The baying of the hounds causes fear within 100ft (per the spell). Normal weapons do not damage the hounds of Yith: silver weapons inflict only 1hp damage per hit, and magical weapons inflict 1hp per point of to-hit bonus. The hounds have 10% resistance to magic.

- Hound of Yith: **HD** 3; **AC** 1\[18\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d6+1); **Move** 18 (Fly 25); **Save** 14; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 7/600; **Special**: Baying, harmed only by magic/silver weapons, magic resistance 10%.

### Yurmp (Toad Robber)

Fat and ugly toad-like humanoids, the Yurmp are bandits and scroungers. Though of fine material, such as silk, their clothes are torn and soiled. Any armour is mismatched and poorly maintained, held together by rusty buckles and double-wrapped cords. Yurmp have sour expressions and grumpy attitudes, often becoming impatient and bored while waiting beside a road or path for someone to ambush. Their weapons are generally polearms looted from battle sites. If yurmp are able to coordinate an ambush, they have an increased chance of surprising their opponents (1-3 on 1d6). In villages that tolerate their presence they are usually part of any organised crime; in areas where they are not tolerated, yurmp live by “finding” dropped items and digging through the garbage of other races, bemoaning their poor luck all the while.

For every 5 yurmp in a group there is a cumulative 2 in 6 chance that a wrestler yurmp will be present. These grossly fat yurmps disdain weapons and armour, and strike for 1d6 damage in unarmed combat. If the unarmed attack succeeds by four or more points, the wrestler has a firm hold on the foe and can throw him to the ground, disarm him, prevent attacks, or inflict continuous strangling damage (1d6 per round). Wrestler yurmps have an effective Strength score of 18, and usually enjoy challenging humans to arm wrestling contests. The rest of the yurmp enjoy gambling on these contests. If yurmp are able to attack by stealth or surprise from behind, they gain +4 on the attack and inflict double normal damage. (*Author: Scott Wylie Roberts, “Myrystyr”)*

- Yurmp: **HD** 5+3; **AC** 4\[15\]; **Atk** 1 polearm (1d8); **Move** 12; **Save** 12; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Backstab.
- Wrestler Yurmp: **HD** 5+3; **AC** 6\[13\]; **Atk** 1 unarmed (1d6); **Move** 12; **Save** 12; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 6/400; **Special**: Backstab, unarmed grapple with hit 4+ over number needed.

### Zetan

Zetans are a grey skinned collective-intelligence race originally hailing from somewhere beyond the material plane. Workers are about four feet tall, and leaders are as tall as six feet. All zetans have thin arms and legs, oversized heads and eyes, and extremely long fingers. They are encountered most frequently on the Ethereal and Astral planes. Their purpose in visiting the Material Plane is a mystery, although they have been known to abduct mortals or livestock, sometimes in broad daylight. Zetans have an aura which causes Fear (as per the spell, saving throw negates), and they are immune to non-magical weapons. It is believed that Zetans are not truly evil, but merely inscrutable and totally alien in motivation; individuals that have met the Zetans will have wildly different stories to tell about them. Smaller Zetans seem to function most often as workers; the taller leader-types are conjectured to have more independence, but still serve the collective. Zetans travel in a thought conveyance which is only temporarily physical, glows various unearthly colors, and is able to become invisible (by entering the Ethereal Plane) at will. For every fifteen Zetans there will always be at least one leader type. A leader must be present for transport of any mortals or livestock. If a Zetan is killed on the prime material plane it is dispatched back to the collective unless its leader is killed as well, in which case it is dispersed. More permanent Zetan fortresses may exist under some of the more inaccessible desert areas of the world; nomads speak of the sound of great machines beneath the sands. (*Author: Michael Kotschi)*

- Zetan (Worker): **HD** 1; **AC** 9\[10\]; **Atk** 1 Weapon (1d4); **Move** 6; **Save** 17; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 3/60 **Special**: +1 or better weapon to hit, Fear aura.

### Zombies

#### Zombie

Zombies are mindless creatures, the walking dead. (These are merely animated corpses, not carriers of any sort of undead contagion as are ghouls.) If their Undeath is contagious, they should be worth a few more experience points than described here, and if a single hit from a zombie causes contagion or any other sort of disease, they should be worth considerably more experience. However, the standard zombie is simply a corpse animated to do its creator’s bidding.

- Zombie: **HD** 2; **AC** 8\[11\] or with shield 7\[12\]; **Atk** 1 weapon or strike (1d8); **Move** 6; **Save** 16; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 2/30; **Special**: Immune to sleep and charm.

#### Brain-Eating Zombie

Brain-eaters are a rare variety of zombie, appearing as bloated, swollen-headed walking corpses. These semi-intelligent monsters hunger for the brains of intelligent creatures, especially those with the ability to cast spells. Brain-eaters are capable of absorbing the energy of magical spells cast near them, negating any effect they might have had. A brain-eater may absorb up to 2d4 spell levels, its head growing ever larger during the process. When its capacity is reached, the brain-eater’s head violently explodes. A brain-eater regains the ability to absorb an additional spell level with each fresh brain it eats. (*Author: Random)*

- Brain-eating Zombie: **HD** 3; **AC** 8 \[11\]; **Atk** 1 strike (1d8); **Move**: 6; **Save** 14; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 5/240; **Special**: Absorbs spells.

#### Brine Zombie

- **HD** 4; **AC** 6 \[13\]; **Atk** 1 longsword (1d8) or 1 hand (1d4); **Move** 12 (12 swim); **Save** 13; **AL** C; **CL/XP** 4/120; **Special** Resist fire (half damage); **Equipment** leather armor, shield, longsword, belt pouch with 1d10hs

#### Leper Zombie

Leper zombies are clearly undead, afflicted with a horrific disease resembling a form of leprosy, more agile than other types of zombies, and far more deadly: any who battle them must save vs disease at the end of the fight or contract Zombie Leprosy (die in 3 days and return as a Leper Zombie). Leper zombies may be turned by clerics as ghouls, and they are immune to sleep and charm spells. Anyone slain by a Leper Zombie reanimates as a leper zombie in 1d6 rounds. Carrying equipment, arms or armor of one slain by a leper zombie or used to destroy a leper zombie carries a risk to the bearer, they must save vs disease at +4 each day or contract Zombie Leprosy. Holy water, remove curse and other methods of cleansing may render the gear safe again. (*Author: JD Jarvis)*

- Leper Zombie: **HD** 1; **AC** 6\[13\]; **Atk** 1 claw or bite (1d6); **Move** 9; **Save** 17; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**: Disease, victims animate as leper zombies.

#### Pyre Zombie

These undead creatures are weirdly enchanted with some sort of necromancy. When hit by a melee weapon, they burst violently into flame, inflicting 1d6 points of damage to anyone within 5-ft. Only the bones remain after this conflagration: the remaining skeleton fights as a skeleton rather than as a zombie (including the lower hit points). The flesh re-grows rapidly, and the creature will fight as a zombie again in 10 combat rounds, including the restored ability to immolate itself. (*Author: Scott Casper)*

- Pyre Zombie: **HD** 2; **AC** 8\[11\] or with shield 7\[12\]; **Atk** 1 weapon or strike (1d8); **Move** 6; **Save** 16; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 3/60; **Special**: Immune to sleep and charm, immolation.

#### Raven Zombie

Zombie Ravens are the rotting, undead bodies of ravens. As with other zombies, they have no independent intellect and move very slowly. (*Author: Matt Finch)*

- Zombie Raven: **HD** 1d6hp; **AC** 8\[11\]; **Atk** 1 bite (1d3); **Move** 1 (Fly 6); **Save** 18; **AL** N; **CL/XP** 1/15; **Special**: Immune to sleep and cold.
